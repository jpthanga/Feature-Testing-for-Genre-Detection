TO THE READER.

It is with great pleasure that we send you a copy of this, the sixth
edition of our brochure on Sexual and Urinary Diseases. The success of
the Civialè Urethral Method, since its first introduction into America,
has been almost unparalleled in Medical History, and we feel that the
time has come for replacing the brief pamphlet containing a mere outline
of the method, with a work somewhat more full and exhaustive.

Aware of the number of worthless and oftentimes actually injurious
remedies that are being advertised and recommended for the cure of
these affections, and the bogus doctors and worthless firms that infest
every large city, we have endeavored to give inquiring patients every
proof and assurance of the efficacy of the Civialè Remedies, every
facility for investigating our methods, and proving, to their entire
satisfaction, both the medical ability of our Consulting Staff, and the
honor, honesty and fair dealing of the Agency. We court the fullest and
freest investigation, either by patients themselves or any friends of
theirs in this city, either of whom we shall be happy to see and satisfy
at any time, at our Consulting Rooms, Business Offices or Manufactory.

Repeated trials in some of the most severe cases of Spermatorrhoea
and Impotency, in both France and America, have proven the Civialè
Remedies to be safe, speedy and most satisfactory in all their results,
and we feel justly proud of having in our hands so excellent and
efficient a means for the radical cure of so obstinate, serious and
often dangerous a disease. We take pride in having saved many a
young and promising life, in having often stayed the hand bent upon
self-destruction, and in having many times cheated the grave or the
insane asylum of its expected prey. Nor do we feel less proud in
having been able, in cases of not so serious, though often of a
more embarrassing nature, to restore to full Sexual Power and Vigor
_middle-aged and older men whose desire had out-lived their power_,
or who, through early abuse, had become so weakened as to be totally
Impotent, incapable of perpetuating their species--ashamed, discomfited,
and disappointed at being somewhat less than a man.

As every case cured is the very best advertisement that we can have,
it is hardly necessary for us to say that we endeavor to exercise the
utmost care, skill and discretion in both diagnosing and treating
these cases, and assiduity and scientific accuracy in preparing and
compounding those remedies of which we are the fortunate possessors.
Indeed, we do everything in our power to make success an absolute
certainty.

A word in closing. Our STAFF OF CONSULTING PHYSICIANS is composed of
men selected with great care for their special skill and attainments in
this special branch of Medical Science. These gentlemen are handsomely
remunerated for their services, and take a pride and interest in every
case they treat.

Our physicians hold no pecuniary interest in the Agency, and hence
prescribe for each case solely on its merits, having nothing to gain
by selling less or more to any one under their care. They see and treat
each case solely and wholly from a medical standpoint, and hence are
never influenced by any pecuniary considerations whatsoever. However
great the reputation of our physicians may be, we have, from the first
organization of this institution, taken and held the ground that the
best interest of the patient is best served by resolutely divorcing the
Medical from the Business Department.

The Civiale Urethral Treatment


_CHAPTER I._

SPERMATORRHOEA--IMPOTENCY--STERILITY.

The Baneful Effects and Consequences of Masturbation, Marriage Excesses,
Venereal and Urinary Diseases on Boys and Men.


Could we read the heart of every man and boy we pass upon the street,
how few--how very few--there are that would not reveal sickening
pictures of lust, disease, melancholy and insanity. Charnel-houses of
sin and lust--sloughs of despond and regret--excess of passion offset
by lack of power--dread, despair, hopelessness, shame and desperation,
making a picture of misery scarcely to be conceived by any but those
unfortunate beings who in the thoughtless, careless heyday of youth, or
the reckless reliance on more mature vigor, have weakened, emasculated
and enslaved themselves by indulgences and excesses that have borne
fruit of misery, disease and desperation in after years.

How little the youth who, in his ignorance of the terrible consequences
of his vice, steals away to the secrecy of his chamber or his bed,
leaving his happy, healthy and playful companions, in order that he
may let the hot waves of lust and passion run riot in his mind, and dry
up every spring of healthy thought and action--how little does he think
of the after-time of misery and exhaustion that he is bringing upon
himself--how little does he think that the vile demon that he is raising
up will, like the vampire, suck his very life-blood, steal away his
strength and life and vivacity, besmirch and weaken his mind, take the
strength from his muscles, the courage from his heart, sap the very
foundation of his existence, unsex and unnerve him, render him feeble,
wavering and imbecile, dog his footsteps to the very steps of the altar,
to curse and blacken and disappoint those joys of parentage and marital
right that should be his. The shadow deepens with him as life advances,
and follows him, bringing shame and misery and despair at every step,
until the poor victim, driven too far, sinks into an early grave by
disease or suicide, or is lost to the world and to all joys and friends
behind the doors of an insane asylum.

He died of no disease known to medical science. He simply faded
away--weaker, more nerveless and hopeless day by day; he faded away
until, almost before any one knew it, the grave yawned to receive him.
Poor, miserable, hopeless wreck--poor suicide, for his own sin and crime
were the real causes of his death.

How many such there are at the present day. We meet them on the street,
in business and at church. Our insane asylums are full of them. We
find their wives unfaithful or unhappy; and their offspring--when they
are cursed with any--poor, miserable, weak fledgelings, with aged,
wasted faces, water on the brain, with rickets and softening of the
bones--idiots or imbeciles--dying early and scarcely regretted even
by the parent whose progeny they are, for every wail of the little
suffering voice pierced his heart and reminded him of his lustful sin,
and passionate, inexcusable indulgence that caused all this misery.

  "And the sins of the father shall be visited upon the children,
  even to the third and fourth generations."

Alas, how true! how indisputable! The imperative Laws of Nature once
broken, the consequences are _inevitable_.

Of late years it has become the fashion amongst certain men to scoff
at this terrible vice of secret indulgence, and to claim that its
evil effects are overrated, are portrayed too vividly. Ask some poor
unfortunate whose confidence you may succeed in gaining, and listen to
the pitiful tale of lost health and vitality he will tell you. Mark well
the wasted hand, the putty-like skin, the black-ringed, lack-lustre
eyes, the heavy lip, the labored breath--read the consequences of his
sin and crime in his shame-faced way, his shambling gait, his nerveless
hands, his fluttering heart, his weakened muscles, and his tottering
memory and mind.

Must he needs lie dead at our feet before these skeptics can be
convinced? Is not such a state a living death? Must these men visit
him in the cell of the asylum, watch him as a raving maniac, gaze upon
him as a hopeless idiot or a driveling imbecile, before they will be
convinced? Such proof is at hand. Not an asylum in any country but has
its score of such; not an asylum record-book but chronicles the sad
histories of thousands of these poor, lost creatures--male and female;
not an asylum nurse or doctor but will sadly point out these creatures
to you, bereft of every trace of reason, all sense of shame, still
practicing the horrible vice that has driven every semblance of humanity
from their faces and the very light of reason from their eyes.

True, every boy or man who practices this vice does not come to this
end. But who shall discriminate? There are thousands such, and who shall
say which it shall be, or at what moment it shall occur? Ah! happy,
rosy-cheeked boy, so gay and thoughtless now, so free from misery,
disease and care, beware! It may be your turn next. A little thoughtless
indulgence, the imitation of friend or companion, though apparently
harmless now, may blanch your rosy cheek, destroy your peace and
happiness of mind, and make a life-long, hopeless, suffering invalid
of you--may shut the door of all earthly enjoyment in your face, blast
your hopes, disease or destroy your offspring, alienate you from friends
and family, and cut off from all communion with your race, make you an
object of shame and disgust to your fellow-men, sink you into an early
grave or entomb you for life in the cold stony walls of a lunatic
asylum.

The day will come, erstwhile, when you will curse the parents who reared
you, the friends who surrounded you and the teachers and ministers who
taught you, for not warning you of the terrible nature of this
indulgence, so secretly common amongst boys and young men.

The day will come, when in the midst of your mental, moral and physical
agony, with weakened mind and exhausted body, physicians will tell you
that masturbation is practically harmless, that its consequences are
exaggerated, and that your sufferings are mostly imaginary. Then will
you pity their ignorance and bemoan the fact that to such men must
sufferers in your terrible extremity apply without any feeling of being
understood, appreciated or sympathized with, and, far less, relieved or
cured.

Happy will you be then, if you can (with your vice and misery staring
you in the face and threatening you with some or all of its dire
consequences) direct your steps to those who not only can and will
sympathize with you, but who are able to aid you with proper remedies
and restoratives and set you safely on the way to health and happiness
again. For there _are_ proper aids and remedies; there are hope and
happiness to be obtained if the affections growing out of this vice
be skillfully taken in hand in time. None but the hopeless sufferers
who have been lifted from the misery, shame and weakness of their
self-inflicted suffering know how much this world owes to the high
medical skill, exhaustive study, and persistent search for truth and
proper remedies of those two great Frenchmen, +Professors Claude
Lallemand+ and +Jean Civiale+. The medical as well as civil honors
conferred upon them by their country and their medical brethren, great
as they were, could never half repay them for the good they rendered
thoughtless youth and suffering manhood by their special discoveries.
There can be no question but that the +Civiale Urethral Crayons+, named
thus after this great specialist, and endorsed by the most eminent
medical men of France (that country in which lust and passion are
peculiarly prevalent), are the most far-reaching and reliable specifics
for Generative, Sexual and Nervous diseases known.


CAUSES OF SPERMATORRHOEA AND IMPOTENCY.
  SELF-ABUSE NOT THE ONLY CAUSE.

Many years' experience in the treatment of these debilitating diseases
has proven very surely that there are many causes besides Self-Abuse
(Self-Pollution, Secret Vice or Masturbation) for Spermatorrhoea,
Impotency and Debility or Lost Manhood. Self-Abuse is the most common
cause, and we therefore give it the most prominence. The others we will
name briefly in about the order of their frequency.

1. MARRIAGE EXCESSES.--A very common cause, more often producing
Impotency (loss of Sexual Desire or Power) and Sterility (inability to
beget offspring), than Spermatorrhoea (loss of vital fluid, daily and
nightly losses, losses in the urine, nervous prostration, debility,
insanity, paralysis, &c. For full description of symptoms, see pages
12-16). Sexual desire was given to mankind, like any other power or
appetite--to be enjoyed in reasonable moderation _and for the purpose of
insuring a continuance of our species by the birth of offspring_. Many
men abuse this power--abuse it inordinately, shamefully--and suffer the
consequences. This is especially true of the newly married, and men
advanced in years, who push their failing powers too far. As a just
retribution for the abuse of so important a function, the Almighty
deprives some of desire, some of power, some of both.

2. ONANISM.--By many this is confused with Masturbation or Self-Abuse.
While like it in some respects and in many of its consequences, it is
still different. It is as hurtful to an adult as abuse is to a young
person. God punished Onan for this sin, hence its name. Yet, despite
this terrible example so plainly set forth in the Old Testament,
probably one-half of the married men of the present day are pursuing it,
and hence so many Impotent and Powerless persons, seeking vainly amongst
the many cheap, quack remedies for something to re-invigorate and
re-vitalize them.

This is a terrible vice, terrible in its consequences, and however hardy
and robust the man, sooner or later his sexual powers must and will
succumb to the strain. Many men write us, saying that they never
masturbated, and yet are totally impotent and cannot understand why
it is. And yet they have been thus injuring themselves for years!

Sexual power and desire were given us for one purpose--the perpetuation
of our species, and whoso endeavors to avoid this, must suffer. Many
married couples do not want more children, from care, poverty or other
causes, and hence the extent to which this terrible practice is
indulged. It _must_ be from ignorance, for were it commonly known how
injurious this practice is, _but few would dare take the terrible risk_.

And yet the resulting weakness can be speedily cured if properly
treated. In no class of cases have the Civiale Remedies achieved greater
success than in these.

3. ANYTHING DEBILITATING--such as Overwork, Confinement, Sedentary
Occupations, Worry, Care, Excitement, &c., &c.--These are much more
common causes of Sexual and Generative Diseases than is generally
supposed, and usually very obstinate and difficult to treat, because
the system is so run down that there is very little stamina or vitality
to rely upon. Clerks, business men, lawyers, bankers, ministers and
students are very subject to this form of impaired vital and sexual
power. Theological students are very prone to it. Many do not have any
idea as to what their real trouble is, and lose much valuable time in
doctoring for Dyspepsia, Consumption, Neurasthenia and the like, when
really their very life and vitality are oozing away from them in their
urine or otherwise.

4. WOMEN'S (OR VENEREAL) DISEASES.--Gonorrhoea (clap), Gleet, Stricture,
Injury to the Urine Canal from the rough use of sounds, bougies,
catheters, &c., &c. Any one or all of these, by extending the
inflammation backward to the seminal ducts and neck of the bladder,
may cause either Spermatorrhoea or Impotency. Indeed, Stricture
(often caused by Self-Abuse) is one of the most common causes of
these complaints. It was here that +Lallemand+ and +Civiale+ found
the key-note of the true treatment of these diseases.

5. VARICOCELE, or a wormy, swollen or twisted state of the veins in the
bag, and of those that run down to the testicles, is a very common cause
of both Spermatorrhoea, Impotency and Debility. (For full description of
this very common and often unexpected disease, send for our illustrated
pamphlet on the subject, or see Chapter XI, page 44 of this book.) No
man or boy with Varicocele, no matter how it was produced, can be
perfectly sound and strong in his Sexual Organs.

6. UNDEVELOPED, WASTED OR MISSHAPEN PARTS.--A failure to have perfectly
developed organs sometimes dates from birth, but in most cases it is
caused by self-abuse at a time when the person is growing. In any case,
Seminal weakness and Wasted or Misshapen Parts go together as both cause
and effect, and the one, when found, will usually very soon lead to the
other. _Twisting or Curving_ is one of the most positive signs of
previous inflammation, stricture and twisting or distortion of the
seminal ducts, and hence sterility or barrenness. In such especially are
the remarkable effects of the +Civiale Treatment+ the most noticeable.
We can say with positiveness, and prove it by case after case, that by
no other method can such rapid and perfect restoration of the organs to
a natural and healthy state be obtained as by this. Some of the very
worst and apparently most hopeless cases that we have had--cases that
have gone from one physician to another without the slightest
improvement--have yielded effectually to the +Civiale Remedies+. In some
of them the persons thus afflicted would have been totally unfitted for
marriage had they failed to find relief. Their children--healthy, happy
and finely developed--speak volumes for what our treatment has done for
them. (For Treatment refer to page +42+ of this book.)


IMPOTENT OLD MEN--
  THE SEXUAL DECAY OF ADVANCING AGE.

We have thus far given briefly the most common causes of Seminal
Disease. There are a few that we have not mentioned: Blows on the Head,
Loins (Small of the Back), Testicles, &c.; Weakness caused by prolonged
illness, fevers, &c.; Malaria, Consumption, &c.; the abuse of Tobacco,
Opium, Alcohol and Chloral, &c., &c.; but these are less common and less
important. There is one condition, however, that we have only referred
to incidentally, and that is the failure of Sexual Power in men past
middle age. No man (if he is reasonably careful and does not abuse
himself) should find his powers decaying before he is seventy or eighty
years of age. Mind, we do not say "no man does," but no man "_should_,"
provided he is reasonably careful.

But here comes the fact. Most men are _not_ careful, and most men _have_
abused themselves at some period. Many believe and stoutly maintain that
they "never had emissions or seminal disease, and it didn't hurt them."
But it did, and it is just now that they begin to feel it. It is true
they escaped the more acute and direful effects, but it told on them in
after years. There are many thousands to-day who are just now feeling
the effects of early vices, now almost forgotten. They can be restored
to _natural_ power by proper treatment, but they rarely are, because but
few of them believe that early self-abuse or later Onanism has anything
to do with it. So they spend a fortune almost--and uselessly too--on
Stimulants, Nervines, Tonic and the like, but still remain partly or
wholly Impotent. Foolish men!




_CHAPTER II._

THE VITAL FLUID

What it Is, What it Does, and How it is allowed to Drain Away,
Weakening, Emasculating and Dementing the Vicious and the Careless.
Diurnal (daily) Emissions. Nocturnal (nightly) Emissions. Impalpable
Oozings. Losses in the Urine. Losses while at Stool. Mistaken Gleet.


There are thousands of weak, nerveless men, who do not know what ails
them; thousands of invalids whose physicians are puzzled and perplexed
by their symptoms, and cannot account for the rapid waste of strength,
energy and vitality, much less check it; and thousands of others, on
the street, in the pulpit, on the bench, in the counting room, whose
troubles, illness and misery are due to losses of vital fluid. Some
know it, many more do not. Some are being properly or improperly treated
for it; many are being dosed and drugged for Malaria, Neurasthenia,
Consumption, Overwork, Brain Troubles, Paralysis and many equally as
foolish and irrational complaints. They sicken, die, destroy themselves
in hopeless despair of ever getting well and strong again, verge into
hopeless idiocy or go raving mad, simply because their trouble is not
understood; because day by day and hour by hour there is draining from
them in their urine, at stool and otherwise, that precious vital fluid
that represents life, health and energy to them.

  {Illustration: Fig. 1.
  A HUMAN TESTICLE.
  Perfectly Healthy.
  [From Gray's Anatomy.]
  Each _lobule_ may be seen (carefully guarded from pressure or injury)
  in its cell, with a strong fibrous partition on each side. All these
  _lobules_ empty into small ducts which converging form the _Globus
  Major_, _Epididymis_ and _Globus Minor_, which finally end in the
  _Vas Deferens_, _Cord_, _Duct_, or _Tube_ that conveys the fluid to
  the Seminal Vesicles at the back of the bladder. (See _Figs._ 5, 6.)
  As the veins of a _Varicocele_ surround these delicate _lobules_
  as well as _fine tubing_, it can readily be seen how easily such
  pressure, weight and crowding may do very serious injury and make
  the flow of semen irregular, or shut it off altogether.}

  {Illustration: Fig. 2.
  HUMAN SPERMATAZOA.
  [From Gray's Anatomy.]
  A. Healthy, well developed and active zoa-sperms from the _Vital
  Fluid_ of a strong, robust man.
  B. Showing cells and bunches, in which form they are secreted or
  made by the testicles.}

And is it surprising that the continual losses do drain away strength
and vitality? This fluid is the only one charged with _life_--actual
_life_; capable of producing _life_--of creating offspring--of
impregnating and developing into perfect being, with thinking and
reasoning brain and mind, pulsating heart, expanding lungs, sentient
nerves, motive muscle, and all that beautiful, minute and co-ordinate
mechanism that forms a perfect human being--the only secretion in the
body capable of propagating species--carrying _life_ within _life_.

Surely this was not meant for waste. Surely the influence of its loss
upon the system, especially of a boy or young man (growing and not fully
developed), must be great, and it is. Many and many a young man thus
wastes away before the eyes of his friends from no other cause. Many a
one loses health and strength from this cause alone, yet does not know
it. How much better if all this false modesty, social hypocrisy, and
blundering medical dosing and drugging, without thorough examination and
full understanding, were wholly done away with, and the young men, and
old men too, were brought to understand two cardinal facts:

(a) The immense devitalizing effects of even small continued losses of
vital fluid, and,

(b) The fact that many apparently strong and healthy, as well as weak
and nerveless, men who find their sexual powers gradually or suddenly
failing them, can, in nine cases out of ten, trace it directly to
losses of vital fluid in the urine or otherwise, that have been going
on--perhaps wholly unknown to them--for months or years past.

(See also chapter on "Hidden Spermatorrhoea")


ANALYSIS OF URINE.

At the first symptom of Sexual Decay or Nervous Exhaustion, the person
thus affected should have his urine carefully and thoroughly analyzed by
some competent person. In saying "competent person," we speak advisedly,
for but few chemists and fewer physicians are competent to make such
an examination and draw correct deductions from what is to be found
there. Any person can, with the proper reagents, test his urine for
the presence or absence of semen, but he cannot make the thorough,
scientific, chemical and microscopical analysis that is sometimes needed
in order to arrive at a full and perfect diagnosis and successful
treatment.

  {Illustration: Fig. 3.

  3, 4. Scales from the Kidney Tubes swollen and degenerated.
  5. Spermatazoa, wasted, shriveled, imperfect and dead. (In this case
  the Varicocele had extended up the cord.)}

If losses of semen are taking place in the urine, it would be well to
forward a sample of it at once, for a full and extended analysis, which
will be made for the nominal fee of $2, merely to cover the cost of
chemicals.

Our Chemical Laboratory is under the supervision of Mr. G. H. E. Du
Bell, Ph.D., a thoroughly competent quantitative and qualitative
analytical chemist, a graduate of the French and German Universities
and also a licentiate in this country, who, with his able corps of
assistants, makes all examinations and reports in full upon them to the
Medical Chief of Staff, who in turn submits them with the histories of
each to the full Consulting Board or Staff.




_CHAPTER III._

THE FORMS, SYMPTOMS AND CONSEQUENCES
Of Masturbation, Spermatorrhoea, Nervous Exhaustion
and Spinal Irritability.


In no disease known to us are the symptoms precisely the same in every
case. They vary with the constitutional peculiarities of the individual.
Yet in nearly every case there are certain prominent or leading symptoms
(signs) that are rarely absent at _some_ stage of the disease. We give
here the more noticeable ones at first laid down by +Lallemand+, the
great French physician, who first gave us the name "Spermatorrhoea,"
who first wrote upon this disease, who was the first to discover the
connection between the losses of semen and certain symptoms here given,
and who, too, was the great originator of that treatment so successfully
perfected by his successor, +Prof. Civiale+, and which is now the
_standard_ treatment, recognized and adopted in all the French
hospitals.


OBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS DUE TO MASTURBATION.

First, as to the appearance and actions of the +Masturbator+--he who is
constantly and recklessly drawing drafts of exhaustion and decay on the
nervous energy and strength of his coming manhood, and which are sure to
bankrupt the most robust health.

If there is a man to be pitied on this earth, it is he who is walking
about from day to day conscious of being guilty of ever having practiced
this vice. Mark the man who is addicted to it in no matter how light a
form; _his face tells the story of his sin_. See his +haggard looks+,
his +deep, sunken eyes+, which he throws only half-way into the
countenance of his friend. _Note the +blue+ or +black discolorations+
under the +eye+; the +nervousness+ to get away from a crowd, and the
extreme +girlishness+ or +backwardness+ when +introduced+ into the
+company of ladies+._

The victim of the most dangerous of all vices soon reaches a state
which, if not promptly relieved by the proper remedy, will end in
life-long misery or an early death.

Objectively considered, the masturbator is recognized by a marked facial
expression, by a characteristic mannerism, and by a peculiar mental
state.

THE FACE.--_The +facial expression+ consists of a +pale+ and +sallow
tint+ of the skin, unusual +development+ of +acne+,--red pimples,--
especially on the +forehead+; a +dark circle+ around the +orbits+;
+dilated+ and +sluggish pupils+; +lustreless eyes+, and an +oblique line
extending+ from the +inner angle+ of the +lids transversely+ across the
+cheek+ to the +lower margin+ of the +malar+ (cheek) +bone+. The +face+
has a +haggard, troubled, furtive expression+._

THE MANNER.--_The +manner+ of the +masturbator+ is peculiar. He is
+listless, shy, retiring+, and +easily confused+; he +avoids society+,
preferring +solitude+; there is a want of +steadiness+ and +decision+
in his +locomotion+; his inferior +extremities+ seem +deficient+ in
+power+, and all his movements betray +a mind ill at ease+._

THE MIND.--_His +mental operations+ are +confused+; his +speech is
embarrassed, awkward+, and +without directness+; his +memory+ is
+defective+, and he is +absent-minded+ and +given+ to +reverie+. If the
habit has long existed, and been excessively frequent in repetition,
+epilepsy+ may be produced; or +serious mental disorder+, as +delusional
insanity+, +dementia+, etc., may occur._

THE SEXUAL ORGANS.--The state of the +genital organs+ varies with the
length of time the habit has been indulged. In some young subjects,
there will be observed an _+extraordinary development+ of the +organ+_,
owing to premature excitement; but the disproportion is not maintained.
Prof. Barthalow says: "With the progress of the habit the organ becomes
_+small+ and +relaxed+, the +erections feeble+, the +corpora cavernosa+
either +waste away+ or their +vessels+ lose their +tonicity+, whereby
an apparent +shrinkage takes place+; the +corpus spongiosum+ and the
+glands+ also +shrink+, so that the +prepuce+ (fore-skin) appears
+unnaturally elongated+. The +testes+ may +increase+ in +size+, become
+tender+ and +irritable+_, or they may waste away to nothing but little
strings; the latter is the more usual result.

"_+Pains+ in the small of the +back+, a sense of +weight+ and +aching+
in the +loins+, around the +anus+, and in the +testes+_ is experienced.
_The +appetite is capricious+, the +digestion feeble, and the bowels+
are +constipated+_, or constipation alternates with diarrhoea.

"_The+ mind+ is +deficient+ in +power+ of +attention+, the +imagination
is constantly pervaded with vague erotic dreams+, the +moral sense+
is +blunted+, and the +perceptions+ are +dull+ and +confused+. +Pains+
in the +head+, in the +occipital+ and +frontal regions+ (front and back
of head)_, and a sense of fullness, and in serious cases _alarming
+Vertigo+ (dizziness and falling); +pains+ in the course of the
+principal nerves+, and an extreme +nervous susceptibility+, are
experienced. The +organic nervous system+_ manifests a functional
disturbance in harmony with the disorder of the nervous system of animal
life. _+Gastralgia+ and +abdominal pain+ (pain in stomach and bowels)_
and +uneasiness+ are in some cases very distressing symptoms.

"The distinctiveness of the foregoing symptoms will be determined
by the extent and duration of the habit, and by the constitutional
peculiarities of the patient. +The more highly developed the nervous
system, and the more it preponderates in activity over the muscular and
digestive systems, the more serious the effects.+


EFFECTS OF MASTURBATION ON THE MIND

"The most serious +mental effects+ are produced by +masturbation+. This
vice, commenced at or before the period of puberty, interferes seriously
with the development of the brain and the evolution of the mental
faculties.

"That +spermatorrhoea+ will produce in one class of cases
+mental disorders+, and not in another, indicates either that some
predisposition to these disorders existed, or that the habit of
+self-pollution+ was merely an expression of +mental alienation+
(insanity). The +images+ which pervade the minds of boys possessed
of the highly-developed nervous organization of masturbators are those
of +delusional insanity+.

"There is, however, a +cerebral+ (brain) +phase+ of spermatorrhoea which
may be separated from the two preceding classes. It is characterized by
_+indistinctness of vision+, +dilatation+ of the +pupil+, +amblyopia+
(near-sightedness), +diplopia+ (double sight); +diminution+ in the
+sensitiveness+ of the +auditory apparatus+ (deafness); +feebleness+
of +voice+; +mental preoccupation+, +hebetude+ of +mind+, +confusion+
of +ideas+, and a +profound melancholy+._

"The termination of such cases is in _+suicidal monomania+, +delusional
insanity+, etc._ In that variety of the cerebral form in which a
decided predisposition must be admitted to exist, to disorder of the
intellectual faculties, there are found various forms of mental
alienation. The +chronic form+ is the most common, which corresponds
to the _+melancholia+ of +Pinel+, or the +lypemania+ of +Esquirol+,
terminating in +dementia+._ Several of the most characteristic cases
which have happened under my observation correspond to the _+delusional
insanity+ of +Bucknill and Tuke+_."--[Manual of Psychological Medicine,
Phila. ed., p. 103.]


INSANITY FROM SPERMATORRHOEA.

Many writers are disposed to underrate the importance of this tendency
in spermatorrhoea. The statistics of any of our large insane asylums
will illustrate the influence of masturbation in the production of
insanity. Mr. Holmes Coote, in a discussion which followed Dr.
Drysdale's paper on the "Medical Aspects of Prostitution," read before
the Harveian Society of London, remarked that "he still entertained the
opinion that there were no worse evils appertaining to human weakness
than this. He had opportunities of witnessing the fact that among the
young there was no cause of insanity more common than indulging in
habits which he would not further particularize, but which were known to
result in the most complete bodily and mental prostration."--[British
Medical Journal, Feb. 17, 1866.]

Dr. John P. Gray, the distinguished Superintendent of the State Asylum
at Utica, New York (Twenty-Fourth Annual Report, 1867), thus speaks of
the +influence of masturbation+ in the production of +insanity+: "The
records of this institution show five hundred and twenty-one cases
admitted directly attributable to this vice, and I am well convinced
that the number is greatly understated."

We might add confirmatory testimony from a variety of sources, but the
foregoing is sufficient for our purpose.

IMPORTANT.--_Peculiar, numb, dead, aching, or tingling sensations in
the hands, arms, legs or feet, and headache and specks before the eyes
on stooping or reading; also sleeplessness, too sound sleep, and
apprehensive dreams should be watched for, and the moment they appear
danger from Paralysis or Insanity is to be apprehended and proper
treatment at once taken. These symptoms may mean nothing in some cases,
but they are terrible harbingers of ill in others._


A CASE OF INSANITY FROM SELF-ABUSE.--(_Fig. 4._)

The following case, taken _verbatim_ from the Care Book of the Insane
Asylum at Blackwell's Island, will serve as a _type_ of the many to be
found in every hospital for the insane in this country. (_And a terrible
and noteworthy fact is, that according to the recent annual reports of
these institutions, both in this country and Europe, insanity, idiocy
and dementia from Seminal Losses and Sexual Abuses, are increasing from
year to year._)

  {Illustration: Fig. 4.
  Appearance of James McC----, a few weeks before he died.
  (See below.)}

"James McC----, admitted to the Asylum ten days ago. Single, clerk, born
in N.Y. State. Was found on 6th Avenue surrounded by a crowd who were
attracted by his violent and frantic efforts to destroy everything
within his reach. On being arrested and taken to the 29th Precinct
Station House, he was recognized by the Sergeant on duty at the desk
as having been arrested twice before within a week--once for violent
shouting and disturbance in the street, and once for an attempt at
suicide by drowning. As he had attempted his life by hanging the last
time he was locked up, and had afterwards seriously injured himself by
trying to dash his brains out, he was adjudged insane, and a watch set
on him all night. In the morning, when taken before the magistrate, he
was violent and abusive, using the most frightfully obscene and profane
language. There he was held for examination and sent to Bellevue in a
"straight-jacket," which was found to be necessary in order to control
him. From the padded cell there he was sent here.

"Upon examination he is found to be suffering from acute mania,
alternating with periods of intense melancholia in which he invariably
attempts to take his own life. His language when excited exceeds in
obscenity anything ever heard. During the intervals of quiet he is
constantly practicing the vile habit which has undoubtedly been the
cause of his insanity. He has lost all sense of shame and continues to
practice before visitors, attendants and physicians. He makes no effort
to go to the water-closet, and his clothes and cell are in a filthy and
disgusting state. Ever since admission he has refused all food, and it
has been necessary to feed him with a stomach pump. He is losing flesh
and strength every day, and is fast wasting away.

"From his relatives who have twice called to see him it was learned
that his mental trouble came on very suddenly, although his memory and
faculties have been failing for some time past. They say that he
complained of sleeplessness, numbness and tingling sensations in the
arms and legs, headache, and a peculiar itching of the skin, for months
before any distinct symptoms of insanity appeared. They attribute it all
to self-abuse, which he has admitted practicing from an early age.

"AUGUST 28th.--Is now paralyzed in both lower limbs. Still violent.

"SEPT. 3d.--Died this morning about 1 A.M. Is so emaciated that he is
little more than skin and bones. _Rigor mortis_ entirely absent. Shortly
after death the skin of the whole body changed to a dark chocolate hue."

Truth is often stranger than fiction. What end more terrible than this!




_CHAPTER IV._

SPERMATORRHOEA, OR LOST MANHOOD.


SYMPTOMS.

Spermatorrhoea may be conveniently divided into three stages.

FIRST STAGE--IRRITATION, CONGESTION.

In this stage the sexual organs of the brain and nervous system first
begin to feel the strain of early abuse, overwork, confinement, sexual
excess, or whatever the cause may be in this particular case.

The Prostate Gland (_j_, _b_, _Fig. 5_) the Seminal Vesicles (_l_,
_Fig. 5_), Cowper's Duct (_n_, _Fig. 5_), the Testicles and Spermatic
Cord (_h_, _f_, _k_, _Fig. 5_), indeed all the sexual apparatus,
including the bulbous sympathetic nerves lying just inside the spine,
from the small of the back down to the end of the organ, become filled
with dark, thick and stagnated blood. The Prostate Gland swells and
becomes enlarged, the Seminal Vesicles become weak, baggy and filled
with a thin, glairy fluid that oozes out into the urine and urine canal
on any little strain, exertion or excitement; especially when, after
being in the presence of the opposite sex, weak, feeble erections
follow. The testicles become flabby and stringy and no longer make
strong, healthy, fecund vital fluid. The constant calls upon them has
exhausted them as also the nerves that gave them life, strength and
vitality. A heavy dragging +weight+ is often felt in the +groin+,
especially after walking or long standing. There is a feeling of
+weakness+ and +exhaustion+ in the parts. Often +strange sensations+
shoot through the parts, and they are +cold+ and +clammy+ at one time,
while +weak+ and +sweating profusely+ at another.

  {Illustration: Fig. 5.
  MALE ORGANS OF GENERATION.
  [From Acton's Celebrated Work on "The Reproductive Organs."]
  _Side view of Body cut in half lengthways_ showing the course taken
  by the +vital fluid+ from the +Testicle+ (where it is made) to the
  Seminal Vesicles (where it is stored). The penis is shown cut off at
  dotted line _g_.

  As shown here the +vital fluid+ secreted in the minute tubules of the
  healthy testicle is gathered into the vas deferens or conveying tube
  _k_, which passing through the groin dips behind the bladder _a_ and
  empties into the Seminal Vesicles or Storehouse _b_. From here it is
  thrown forcibly into the urethra (urine canal) _e_, when needed, and
  expelled anteriorly by the ejaculatory muscles of the urethra. To
  reach the urethra the Seminal Duct _m_ passes directly through the
  body of the Prostate Gland _j_-_b_. Upon the outside of the testicle,
  the tube or duct is found twisted and forming a slight bunch, known
  as the epididymis, _f_, _g_, _h_.

  It is here that the pressure of a +Varicocele+ is first felt--here
  that it succeeds _in cutting off the free upward flow of vital fluid_
  by pressure on these soft branches of the duct, causing +emissions+
  by varying and irregular pressure and +Impotence+ by constant
  pressure. When the +Varicocele+ becomes very large, it then destroys
  the delicate tubing or the testicle itself.}

The general nervous system also feels the +strain+ and +drain+. +Memory
and application+, +good judgment+, +decision of character+, and
+clear-sightedness+ are not what they were. +Headaches+ are not
uncommon. +Bashfulness and trepidation+, especially in the presence of
females, is the rule. The person feels +clumsy+, +embarrassed+ and +ill
at ease+. +Sleep+ is sometimes poor, there are occasionally +terrible
dreams+, sometimes +lascivious ones+ accompanied by +emissions+,
+drowsiness+ and a tired, languid feeling in the morning, and a
+disinclination to rise+ and go to work are certain signs of +impending+
nervous exhaustion. +The eyes are dull and heavy+, often +black-ringed+
underneath. The pupils of the eyes are unequal--often very
large--sometimes one small and one large. The hands tremble and perspire
+easily+. The person is +absent-minded, melancholy, prone to brood, and
fears the jests+ or ridicule of his companions. The +skin+, especially
of the +face+, sometimes becomes +coarse and red, sometimes is pale and
pasty+ and covered with +blotches or pimples+. There is sometimes +spasm
at the neck of the bladder+, causing +some delay before the urine will
flow freely+. Often it is passed in a +forked or twisted stream+,
plainly showing the presence of either organic or spasmodic stricture.
+Twitching of the muscles of the eyelid, face and limbs+ is often
present, accompanied sometimes by +creeping sensations up the spine+,
+flushings of the face+, +chills+ (slight), +dizziness and black spots
before the eyes+ on stooping over and occasionally by neuralgic pains in
the +head+ and about the heart. If unchecked, or if the baneful habit is
still persisted in, the symptoms of the First Stage merge rapidly into
those of the


SECOND STAGE.--CONGESTION AND INFLAMMATION.

Here all the symptoms of the foregoing stage are usually present, only
somewhat more intensified. The +congestion+ and +irritation+ are +more
decided+, the +weakness+ more marked, the +nervous prostration+ more
decided. Any, many, or all of the following symptoms may be present,
according to the degree of severity or the rapidity of the disease:

+Emissions+ (day or night), +Oozing of a glairy fluid+ under excitement
and imaginings, presence of the opposite sex, etc., +Partial+ and
+Imperfect Erections, Desire to Masturbate+, Formation of +Evil Pictures
in the Mind+, +Flushing and Chilliness+, +Stupidity and Tendency to
Doze or Sleep+, +Mental Hebetude+, +Failing Memory+, +Lack of Power
of Application, Energy or Concentration+, +Restlessness+, +Pain and
Smarting+ in passing urine, +Wetting the Bed+, +Pain in the Kidneys+,
+Headache+, +Pimples+ on the face or body, +Itching or peculiar
sensations+ about the scrotum (bag), thighs, legs, anus, etc., +Wasting+
of the +Organs+, +Stringiness and Softening+ of the +Testicles+,
+Dyspepsia+, +Sluggish Bowels+, +Torpid Liver+, +Failing Sight+, +Pains
in the Head+ (front, top and back), Chest, Limbs, etc., Sensation of the
+Bowels Falling Out+, +Dizziness+ on stooping over or kneeling, +Specks+
before the +Eyes+, +Erotic Dreams+, +Melancholy+ (developing sometimes
into +Insanity+), +Numbness+ of arms, hands, feet or legs (precursors of
+Paralysis+), +Twitchings+ of the muscles of the eyelids and elsewhere
(sometimes ending in +Epileptic Fits+ or +St. Vitus' Dance+),
+Timidity+, +Diabetes+ and +Deposits+ in the +Urine+, +Troubled
Breathing+, +Indecision+, +Loss of Will Power+, +Bashfulness+, +Burning+
of the face, +Coldness+ and +Clamminess+ of the feet and hands, also of
the +Scrotum+ (or bag), +Palpitation+ of the heart, +Early Loss of fluid
during connection+, +Feelings of Gloom, Despondency, Hopelessness+ of a
cure, or fear of impending danger or +misfortune+, +Tenderness of the
Scalp+ and +Spine+, +Dryness+ and +Itching of the skin+, +Sudden
Sweating+, +Sudden Nervous Trembling+, +Noises+ and +Reports+ in the
ears and brain, +Weight+ on the brain, +Weak+ and +Flabby Muscles+,
easily tired after slight exertion, +Desire to Sleep late+ in the
mornings and +failure to be rested+ by sleep, +Weakness+ and +Torpor+
the day after a nightly emission has occurred, the +Oozing of thick
white fluid+ from the urethra when +constipated+ or +straining at
stool+, +Varicocele+, etc., etc.


WEAKNESS AND WASTING OF THE ORGANS.

As a rule the +organs waste away+ rapidly or become +curved, twisted, or
misshapen+. Oftentimes the testicles +dwindle away+ to almost nothing.
+Settled gloom+ and +melancholy+ pervade the mind, and +hallucinations+,
+morbid fear+, +unnatural lust+, +groundless jealousy+ and a +morbid
desire for solitude+ show themselves. Undoubtedly the list of promotive
causes is considerably augmented by maltreatment and the employment of
injudicious remedies. We should therefore suggest to all prudent persons
the wisdom and importance of consulting _competent authority_ only.
Self-enervation in the first instance brings about that irritability
which evinces itself in +nocturnal discharges+, afterwards in
inappreciable but exhaustive +diurnal discharges+, and subsequently in
complete debility of the whole generative system. This seminal fluid,
such indeed as it is--weak, effete and devoid of all generative
power--is undoubtedly the fluid which the organs suffer to escape; and
to prevent further its flow, as well as to give a healthy tone to the
secretory and retentive vessels ought to form our first care.


COUGH, CONSUMPTION AND GENERAL DEBILITY AND PROSTRATION.

It is a curious pathological fact, that during the progress of
Spermatorrhoea, difficulty of breathing, cough, and tightness of the
chest, arising in many constitutions from the seminal disorder, have
sometimes been actually mistaken for pulmonary consumption. The cough
is often distressing, occasionally attended by an expectoration of an
offensive kind. There is no doubt that many have been maltreated for
consumption when Spermatorrhoea was the real malady. That the latter
leads to the former is certain enough, but the stages and connections of
the respective diseases have been grossly misunderstood by practitioners
who have not had sufficient personal acquaintance with the indications
of Spermatorrhoea.

Remember that these continued seminal discharges of an involuntary
character disorder every function of the animal economy, and it may
be added that while Spermatorrhoea produces so many ruinous effects
peculiar to itself, it aggravates and excites any other disease which
may co-exist with it.

The +features+ become +pale, emaciated and haggard+. The +eyes are dead,
sunken+ and lustreless, and in many cases hold in their depths +a look
of wild, unsettled fear that denotes rapidly approaching insanity+. The
+bowels+ become +sluggish+, the +appetite capricious+, the +muscles
weak+, the +urine pale+ and with +a heavy sediment of semen+ that
drains away in it almost constantly. +Emissions+ at night becoming more
frequent and copious--sometimes bloody--although the fluid secreted
by the wasted testicles is +scarcely stronger than water+. +Sexual
incapacity shows itself.+ +Ejaculation+ is either +too quick+ or else
very +long delayed+. The +skin+ becomes dry and sallow, the +liver
congested and sluggish+. +The heart beats irregularly+, and any sudden
sound, movement or fright sets it to beating violently. +Shortness of
breath+ is complained of. +The brain becomes weaker and more sluggish
day by day.+

  {Illustration: Fig. 6.
  DIAGRAMMATIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THE TESTICLES, DUCTS, &c.
  Showing where the vital fluid is made and stored and how, and by
  what means it passes from the +Testes+ (where it is made) to the
  +Vesicles+ (where it is stored). The heavy black marks on either
  side of the urine channel, show the relative position of the
  ejaculatory muscles.}

He generally loses flesh, and feels uneasiness in his stomach which
suffers from many of the symptoms accompanying dyspepsia. He is easily
startled; the slamming of a door, the firing of a cracker, the falling
of a book, a sudden touch, or even speaking to him unexpectedly, will
cause him to start. Cowardice is a sure consequence of Self-Abuse and
involuntary emissions. The appetite is irregular, often poor, sometimes
voracious; the bowels are also variable in their action. The prostatic
portion of the urethra is frequently irritable and sometimes is very
much +inflamed+; oftentimes there is a +thickening, a sponginess or
puffiness+ of the parts immediately involving the ejaculatory ducts.
The mucous membrane of the vesiculæ seminales becomes inflamed and
thickened. The +testicles+ and the +spermatic cord+ are oftentimes
very tender and the seminal fluid is much thinner than natural. Such a
Patient has generally +dark spots under his eyes+, +a sharp nose+, and
often +flushes of hectic color+ in his cheeks, particularly when in the
presence of company, and there is more or less palpitation of the heart.
In the second stage, as in the first, the pollutions are diurnal and
nocturnal; the latter are copious and recur frequently. So insensible
is the passage of semen that the patient is usually astonished and
horrified on waking to find himself and +bedclothes saturated+ with this
fluid, which is easily absorbed by the clothes, and rapidly dries up,
because it has become thin, watery and effete. In addition to this
loss he is subject to one equally great on almost every occasion
of +urinating+ and +defecating+. This also takes place without any
consciousness on his part, and his only knowledge of the fact is from
the alarming weakness he experiences after passing water or going to
stool. Distraction or absence of mind renders the judgment unfit for any
extensive enterprise.

The sexual powers are greatly weakened; the overtaxed organs refuse to
fulfill their legitimate task; their susceptibility and irritability are
so great that the power of retention is lost, and the seminal fluid is
discharged prematurely.

The generative organs are wasted and inactive, or so weakened as to
secrete but a ropy, thin and glairy fluid, having few or none of the
characteristics of Vital Fluid. Should the individual suffering this
way--and either careless or unfortunate enough to go uncured--have
offspring, they will assuredly be puny in body and weakly in mind, and
will lead a miserable existence through the neglect and indiscretion of
their parent.


THIRD STAGE.--STAGNATION AND WASTING.

This stage is an aggravation of the two preceding stages combined.

The emissions are accompanied and followed by a disagreeable and
disgusting sensation of shame and misery. The mind is absorbed as much
as can be by the one idea of its wretched situation, and the sufferer is
haunted by the thought that his condition and its cause are known to the
whole world, and that he is pitied or scorned by every person he meets.
He is hypochondriacal, and fearful suggestions of self-destruction ever
and anon present themselves.

The power of mental concentration is entirely gone and the memory is
so feeble that the patient continually forgets what he begins to say.
The dimness of vision is continual and so great as to be a material
annoyance; the eyes are wandering or fixed upon the ground, seldom
venturing to meet the gaze of another. The +ringing in the ears+, +pains
in the head and over the eyes+ are almost perpetual and frequently
accompanied by partial deafness. +The heart is the seat of pain+,
+fluttering+ and +throbbing+ with +violent and long-continued
palpitation+, his hands shake, his limbs tremble, his knees are weak, so
much so that at times it is almost impossible for him to walk erect. He
experiences an insatiable desire for sleep, and yet upon retiring he
lies awake for hours, tormented by his troubled reflections, and at last
falls into an uneasy slumber, of short duration, disturbed by wretched
dreams.

+Hard, red pimples+ frequently appear on the face, forehead and body,
+scaly patches+ round the +ears, eyes, nose and lips+, a +black or
bluish semi-circle+ shows itself under the +eyes+, and there is a hollow
mark from the corner of the eye in a slanting direction under the
cheekbone to the angle of the mouth, which tells its tale. The +skin is
livid and clammy+ and the digestion is bad. The patient is tormented
with +flatulency+, which he cannot always control and which he justly
dreads, as it renders him an object of +disgust+ to all in his presence.
The bowels are generally +constipated+, obliging him to strain much at
stool, thus aggravating the irritation of the prostate gland vesiculæ
seminales and increasing the +seminal losses+.

The bladder is irritable and will retain the urine but a short time; the
ureters and kidneys are also inflamed and in post-mortem examinations
are sometimes found to contain +abscesses+; they are the seat of much
pain when pressure is made over the intervertebral spaces of the dorsal
and lumbar vertebræ or backbone. The vesiculæ seminales have +been
indurated+ and can be felt to be +knotty+ and +hard+. The spinal marrow
is very sensitive throughout its whole extent; the cerebellum is the
seat of a +dull+ and +heavy pain+, and there is a feeling of pressure
upon the brain. Cerebral congestion now and then occurs. This stage of
the disease is frequently accompanied by +Bronchitis+ or a continued
+Catarrh+, also by disease of the +rectum+ and all the +tissues near
the generative organs+.

It is hardly necessary to say that the functions of the nervous system
are completely deranged, indeed, +nervous twitchings+ of the +eyelids+,
+head+ and +limbs+ are the consequences of +Spermatorrhoea+. He is
finally either hurried to a premature grave by consumption, epilepsy or
apoplexy; or insanity, taking the hopeless form of dementia, has removed
him from his home to the madhouse.

It is safe to say that of all the cases of incurable insanity, a large
majority are caused by Spermatorrhoea.

Many, owing to +sheer neglect+ or to +false notions of delicacy+, delay
seeking for proper medical relief until they are almost destroyed, and
body and mind are nearly in ruins.

Pitiable the picture of one who has +reached+ this stage of the disease.
The organs are still congested but +irritability+ has given away to
+torpor+ and +sluggishness+. Semen drains away by day and night without
provocation, these constant losses dragging the person to the very
+brink of the grave+, or +standing him+ within that +melancholy shade+
where +suicide+, +insanity+ or +idiocy+ almost certainly stares him in
the face. The organs are wasted almost totally away. All +strength+,
+vitality+, +erectile+ and +procreative power+ have left them, and the
victim is at last totally +impotent+. Of no use to themselves, a curse
to their freinds, a disgrace to society, they sink from sight into an
early grave or are lost to the world behind asylum doors. It is a sad
and terrible picture, but true--too true--to life.

The tendency of Nature in most disorders is towards cure, but +here it
is towards deterioration+. There is no chance here of the evil "wearing
itself out" save in madness and death on the one hand, and on the other
by the salutary intervention of the most +vigorous+, +cautious+ and
+enlightened treatment+, a treatment pursued in the +full light+ of the
aids afforded by the great discoveries in physiological science for
which the present age is happily distinguished. Fortunately for
humanity, by the aid of Chemistry, as well as Medical Science, it has
been reserved for us to present to the public the +Civiale Remedies+,
which have proved themselves undeniable blessings to thousands,
restoring with unerring power those suffering from this hitherto
baffling complaint.


LESS SEVERE CASES.

There are cases where the effects of early abuse are neither so
rapid nor so severe. In many instances the persons, to all outward
appearances, are strong and robust. They only complain of certain sexual
symptoms that trouble them. But let them beware. Appearances are very
deceitful. Let a sudden fit of illness supervene and see how quickly
these apparently healthy men succumb and are swept away by it. Then,
too, in many of these cases, he who to-day may seem strong and healthy,
with the exception of his sexual weakness, may suddenly develop most
grave nervous symptoms, and in less than a month be beneath the sod or
hopelessly insane. Such cases have occurred, and one particular instance
even as we write presents itself to our mind. Poor fellow, he died a
raving maniac the very night he was to have been married to one of the
most charming young ladies in New Haven. And yet he thought he was
perfectly healthy. He only learned his true condition too late for
human aid.


HIDDEN SPERMATORRHOEA.

In many cases the seminal ducts have become so weak and relaxed that
the fluid passes off involuntarily with the water and is not perceived;
also when straining at stool and when you have an erection. To test its
escape in the urine, pass off your water in a clear glass pint bottle
and let it stand twenty-four hours in a warm place; then hold up the
bottle between yourself and the light, and if you discover a sediment
of a +white, fleecy+ nature, resembling cotton, in the bottom, you are
suffering from +hidden spermatorrhoea+, from which all your present
ailments come. Where this fluid passes off with the urine, it is just as
injurious to the system as full emissions, as it is a continual drain
day after day, as well as taking that part of the vitality which goes
to supply the brain and nerves. Many patients afflicted in this way
will notice, shortly after urinating, a +dull pain+ in the forehead,
sometimes extending to the +eye-balls+, causing, as well, a feeling of
+general debility+, as if they had no strength or will to do anything.
If this weakness is allowed to go on unchecked, the mind will become
diseased, the eye-sight will be impaired, and the vital forces
consumed--thereby causing +partial and complete impotency+. Should you
desire greater certainty in testing, either send on a sample of your
urine, or test it with our powder.

The characteristic symptoms of partial impotency are: an imperfect
erection, or, if the erection is sufficiently vigorous, it is of too
short a duration, and the vital fluid is discharged prematurely.

The erector muscles become paralyzed, and the organ remains inactive at
the call of the will.

The person thus afflicted is greatly embarrassed and mortified at his
paralytic condition. That buoyancy of spirit is gone; the snap, vim and
vigor that once held sway has departed--and why? Because that great
motive power (amativeness) that gives the push and go-aheaditiveness is
checked, or rather, ceases to act.


THE CURABILITY OF SPERMATORRHOEA AND IMPOTENCY.

Having before us the records of some three thousand cases, grave, simple
and severe, that have come under our treatment in this country, as well
as the printed copies of the +French Hospital Reports+, and +Civiale's
Works+, in which he minutely reviews all phases of this complaint,
illustrating them with cases from his own practice, we feel justified
in assuring our readers that almost any case can be cured, provided
+thoroughness+ is the maxim of treatment.

The method of Profs. +Jean Civiale+ and +Lallemand+, as now perfected
and extended by us, and so justly named after +Civiale+, stands
unrivaled in its +success+ as well as its +simplicity+ and
+reasonableness+. To all such as suffer from this harassing complaint
we commend, first, a careful reading of the history of this discovery
and the eminent medical men and hospitals that endorse it; and, second,
a fair trial of these remedies, no matter how +hopeless+, +despondent+
and +despairing+ you may be. (See page 55.)

Although the advertising and spreading, and the ringing to full
perfection of this treatment is really due to us and our physicians,
still we feel in duty bound to always keep in view the two great French
surgeons who first discovered the method of +intra-urethral medication+.




_CHAPTER V._

IMPOTENCY OR LOST POWER.


Scarcely a day passes that we do not have some patient inquiring +"What
is Impotence?"+--+"Are Impotence and Spermatorrhoea the same Disease?"+

+Impotency+ (from the Latin words _im_ [not] and _potens_ [to be able]
means a condition of the Sexual Organs in which a man is not able to
beget his species. It may be because he has lost his erectile power (and
this is how it is most commonly understood), or because he has lost all
desire, or lastly, because the +vital fluid+ has become so +weakened+
and +degenerated+ as to have lost its +procreative power+.

Impotence is most common in men past middle age. It may come on as _the
second or third stage of Spermatorrhoea_, or it may develop slowly or
suddenly _without any symptoms of Spermatorrhoea_. It may be accompanied
by various +nervous+ and +exhausting+ symptoms, or these may be _wholly
absent_. If vital fluid is being lost, and the Impotence is due to the
weakness thus caused, +nervous exhaustion+ is sure to come sooner or
later.

Impotence and Spermatorrhoea may exist together in the same person.

Many impotent men have no other bad symptoms than simply this failure of
the +sexual organs+ to respond when called upon. The trouble in these
cases usually lies in the erectile muscles, which are +weakened+ or
+paralysed+, and in the +nervous bulbs+ or +ganglia+, that are blunted
or exhausted.

A perfectly healthy man should be able to beget his species until he is
+at least+ 80 years of age. Instances of such power at the age of 97 are
on record. In these days of +exhaustion+, +early decay+, +excesses+ and
+abuse+, most men begin to lose their power at or before 40. This is not
right, and can +certainly+ be remedied by proper treatment.


IMPOTENCY, COMPLICATED WITH BLADDER OR PROSTATE DISEASE.

In such cases the Prostate Gland is usually congested, enlarged and
irritated, and needs prompt and thorough treatment. (See page 26.) The
tone of the nervous system is also lowered, even though it may not be
apparent to the individual himself. Hence, some good, strong, special,
general and sexual tonic, such as +Civiale's Tonic Regulator+ (see page
30) is needed, as is shown by the rapid improvement that follows its
use, especially when combined with effective measures for strengthening
the +erectile muscles+, invigorating the +Sexual Nerve Ganglia+, and
reducing the +Prostatic congestion+. Some of the most remarkable cases
of the thorough cure of Impotence and restoration to full sexual vigor
that appear in the 53d Volume of the French Hospital Reports, were in
men +past 60 years of age+.


IMPOTENCY AND WASTING OF THE ORGANS.

In many of these cases of impotence (as well as of Spermatorrhoea)
the organs were either small and puny from birth or had wasted away as
the disease progressed--just as a paralyzed arm or leg will waste away
from want of use and exercise. Such cases, as also those where there is
twisting or curving of the organ, need thorough developmental treatment.
Such organs can be readily developed under proper treatment, just as the
breast or a limb may be developed and increased in +size, strength and
power+ by the use of the proper treatment. Those who have not kept pace
with the advances of medical science abroad can scarcely realize how
great her strides have been. To-day it is easy (especially in Sexual,
Seminal and Urinary diseases) to do what ten years ago the majority of
physicians deemed impossible, and to +Lallemand+ and +Civialè+ belong
the highest meed of praise for their unremitting labors in bringing
this branch of medical science to its present state of comparative
perfection. As an illustration we can cite case after case that has been
sent us by physicians in good standing as utterly beyond their skill,
and we have returned their patients to them in a few months' time fully
and +perfectly restored to sexual strength+ and +vigor+ as they,
themselves, were obliged to admit.


IMPOTENCY AT ANY AGE IS CURABLE.

Do not despair then, reader, if you are thus afflicted and have made
several trials and failed to find +health+ and +vigor+. The +Civiale
Remedies+, while not infallible, have certainly done wonders for many
so-called "+hopeless cases+," and we doubt not that you, too, can be
perfectly restored. Submit your conditions and symptoms to our Board of
Consulting Physicians, and at least get their opinion upon it. Certain
it is that these remedies, brought to light by the eminent French
savant, Professor in the greatest medical college in France, and adopted
and endorsed by all the large Parisian hospitals and most eminent French
physicians, +cannot possibly hurt you+, and +more than likely will cure
you+.




_CHAPTER VI._

BLADDER, KIDNEY, PROSTATIC AND URINARY DISEASES.


Congestions, irritation and even inflammation of the Urinary Organs
often occur in men, either alone or as a complication of Seminal Disease
and Weakness. The Seminal Vesicles lie just behind the bladder, while
the Seminal Ducts pass through the body of the +Prostate Gland+, and
open into the urethra (or urine channel) upon its surface (see Fig. 5).
Hence, any inflammation or congestion of this large gland that lies at
the root of the organ and neck of the bladder, is almost certain to
produce +Seminal Weakness+, +Losses+ and +Impotence+.

It will be noticed that men past 50 years of age are often forced to
rise in the night once or oftener to make water. This, and the delay
that sometimes occurs before the stream will start, are usually due to
enlarged +Prostate Gland+--a common condition in men past 50. Many and
many a man at this age finds his +sexual power declining+ and cannot
understand it--+Enlarged Prostate Gland+.

As the gland enlarges and becomes stiff and its tissues hardened and
brawny, it presses upon and deprives the Sexual Nerves of power and
sometimes paralyzes them, causing total Impotency. How useless--worse
than useless, even hurtful--are the usual remedies. The Prostate Gland
must be softened, cooled and +robbed+ of its +inflammation+ before
Anti-Impotency remedies can be of the slightest service. And here it
is where the great success of the +Civiale Crayons+ is best shown:
+The Prostatic Crayons melt, run down upon, soothe, quiet and allay
the inflammatory and hardened gland+, while the +Impotence Crayons+ are
+re-toning+, +strengthening+ and +re-vitalizing+ the Sexual Nerves, and
strengthening the +erectile+ and +ejaculatory+ muscles. Perfect cure and
perfect restoration are possible if +proper+ means are +properly+
applied.

Spermatorrhoea likewise is both caused and complicated by +Prostatic+
and +Urinary+ inflammation. The Sexual Nerves are involved and weakened
in the same manner as in Impotency, while, in addition the hardened
substance of the Prostate Gland keeps the mouths of the Seminal Ducts
open, and the +vital fluid+ runs away into the +urethra+ to be swept out
with the urine, without let or hindrance. Soon this loss tells, not only
upon the brain and nerves and general health, but upon the testicles
where this fluid is made. So much is wasted that these two glands, work
as they may, cannot supply a sufficiency of good, healthy fluid, and
meet the difficulty by making a thin, watery infertile fluid that would
flow away even if the mouths of the ducts were healthy. They do this at
the cost of a terrible strain upon the whole system--they strain and
injure themselves and grow +weak and flabby+ and finally +wasted+--often
rupture small vessels in their substance, thus yielding +bloody or black
seminal fluid+.


The _CAUSES_ of Prostatitis or Prostatorrhoea are many and diverse.
The most prominent are:

_Gonorrhoea or Gleet_, running backward and settling in the gland or
neck of the bladder;

_Stricture_, deep in the canal, causing congestion and inflammation;

_Masturbation_, by keeping the gland excited, congested and irritated,
often causes it;

_Exposure to cold and wet_, especially sitting on a cold door-step or
damp seat;

_Blows and Injuries_ of any kind;

_Strong Injections_, and rough jabbing with steel sounds or rough
bougies;

_Eating Hot Condiments_, or too free indulgence in alcoholic beverages.


VARIOUS COMPLICATIONS.

If the inflammation extends to the neck of the +bladder+, he has an
attack of +cystitis+. If it goes down along the seminal ducts, it
produces +swelled testicle+, +clogged duct+, +chronic enlargement+,
+cancer+, +cysts+ and hopeless wasting of the +testicles+. If it extends
up the +ureters+, it causes +Bright's Disease+, +abscess+ of the
+kidneys+, or +lumbar fistula+. If it runs forward along the urine
canal, it produces so-called +gleet+. If it settles in the +prostate
gland+ and becomes chronic, it may cause +abscess of the gland+,
+retention of the urine+, and certainly either or both +Spermatorrhoea+
or +Impotency+.

It may thus be seen how exceedingly dangerous a disease this
+Prostatitis+ is, and how very important it becomes to check it at
the earliest possible moment.

SYMPTOMS.--We have space for but the most prominent and frequent ones:
a +dull, aching, dragging+ or +throbbing pain+ between the legs, made
worse by +standing, walking, jolting+, &c., and sometimes relieved by
hard pressure, or lying down with one's feet higher than their head;
pain, burning or smarting on passing urine; +twisting+ of the stream;
the oozing of a thin, glairy fluid; +sticking+ together of the lips of
the mouth of the urinal canal; +soreness, aching or tenderness+ of one
or both +testicles+; dull pain or ache in +the small of the back+ or
+buttocks+; +dizziness, sudden fits of exhaustion, convulsions, coma
and death+. A +microscopical examination+ of the urine will reveal the
nature of the difficulty in a moment. There also will be found evidences
of great +nervous wear and tear, and seminal losses+, more or less
constant.

  +Civiale+ and +Lallemand+ were Professors.}


GLEET AND STRICTURE AS A CAUSE OF SPERMATORRHOEA AND IMPOTENCY.

These two diseases are probably less understood than almost any other
equally common. It is safe to say that at least one man out of every
ten has, has had, or will have one or both. Neglected gleet often causes
stricture; neglected or improperly treated stricture often causes and
keeps up a gleet.

Another set of statements, equally sweeping and based upon the best of
medical evidence, may be made, _i.e._, more cases of gleet and stricture
are caused by Self-Abuse (masturbation, Onanism), and sexual excesses
than by gonorrhoea--formerly and ignorantly supposed to be about the
only cause.

Furthermore, the main cause of both Spermatorrhoea and Impotence is
Stricture (whether caused by self-abuse, gonorrhoea [clap], or any other
excess). It was this very important point that +Lallemand+ guessed at,
and that +Civiale+ definitely ascertained to be a fact--proved it by
examinations of both living and dead subjects, and demonstrated it
before the eyes of every member of the French Academy of Medicine,
the most learned body of medical men in the world. Upon this discovery
is based the now world-famed +Urethral Crayon Treatment+. It
cures--absolutely, thoroughly and +Permanently+ cures--because it is
based on truth; because the proper remedies are placed upon the very
seat and fountain-head of the disease; where quickly and thoroughly it
stamps out the fire (inflammation, from the Latin _in_, and _flamma_, to
burn, to be a-fire) and eradicates the cause, at the same time healing
the abrasions, releasing and invigorating the nerves, cleansing and
unclogging the ducts, strengthening the erectile muscles--in a word
restoring the whole Sexual Apparatus to its natural tone and strength;
not harshly or violently, but gently, kindly, soothingly. Indeed it is a
heavy debt of gratitude the sufferers from Sexual Disease and Weakness
owe to +Professor Jean Civiale+--greatest of all French savants!!

STRICTURE THE RESULT OF MASTURBATION,
AND THE CAUSE OF WEAKNESS AND IMPOTENCE.

In brief it may be stated that +Masturbation+ in early life, and
sexual excesses at a later period, may, and do produce +congestion+,
+inflammation+, +spasm+, +ulceration+, +granulations+, +ulcers+,
and both +spasmodic and organic strictures+ of the urethra; that
+Spermatorrhoea+ and +Impotence+ are due to this condition, and that
the only really rational treatment is that which directly medicates and
heals these parts. This, +Civiale's Soluble Urethral Crayons+ do, better
and quicker than anything else. Prof. GROSS,{24} for instance, says:
"Exclusive of these cases, my notes show that 13 out of every 100 cases
of stricture are due to Onanism;" and OTIS{25} says: "9 per cent. of all
cases are traceable to that practice." REEVES, HENRY SMITH, GOULET,
PHYSIC and LEROY give masturbation as a cause of stricture. BLACK states
a like case leading to sexual incapacity, as a result of the stricture.
WADE says: "In several instances of the kind, +where there had been no
sexual intercourse+, the strictures, which were at the bulb, proved more
than usually refractory from the extreme morbid sensitiveness of the
whole urethral canal."

Gross goes on to say, that in at least eight out of every ten cases of
+Spermatorrhoea+ or +Impotence+, stricture of the urethra is the cause
of the trouble, whether the stricture is due to gonorrhoea, gleet, etc.,
or to +masturbation or excesses+.

    {Footnote 24 _Op cit., page 25._}

    {Footnote 25: _Op cit._}


THE CIVIALE PERFECTED AND COMBINED TREATMENT.

How senseless, then, to endeavor to cure such conditions with stomach
medicines. Still, the CIVIALE method does not wholly discard them.
They have their place and their purpose, and served it well. It was
his practice in many cases to use +Nervines+ and +Tonics+, as well
as +Digestives+ and +Laxatives+, by the stomach, and with excellent
results, for in many of these cases the +digestion was poor+, the +liver
torpid+, the +bowels sluggish+ and +constipated+, and +filled with
wind+, the +appetite capricious+ and +uneven+. +Crayons+ in the urethra
could not wholly cure these symptoms, although they stopped the drain
that originally caused them. Combined with the +Tonic-Regulator+, the
results were prompt and satisfactory.

+Many patients began to recuperate the moment the inflammation,
stricture, ulceration and accompanying losses of vital fluid were
stopped, and were soon in robust health again+. In others, however,
he found it best, +at the same time that he was healing the diseased+
urethra, to +clear and invigorate the debilitated nerves and weary
minds, to tone up the stomach and bowels, set the liver gently working,
start the kidneys+ (nearly always congested), +and infuse new life,
strength and vigorous impulses into the whole system by means of his
Tonic-Regulator+, which is a pleasant and most efficacious combination
of +tonics+, +laxatives+ (not purgatives), and +deobstruents+. +Skin,
kidneys, lungs, heart, mind, nerves, stomach, liver and bowels, were
all set to working right+. And, as a consequence, aided by the urethral
remedies, the +losses ceased+, erectile power and +sexual vigor
returned, the step became buoyant and elastic, the mind clear, the
memory retentive, the eyes clear and bright, the lips and cheeks ruddy
with healthful color; the whole system, indeed, renovated, refreshed and
re-invigorated.+




_CHAPTER VII._

THE DUTIES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND FAILURES
IN AND OF MARRIED LIFE.


What more perfect or pleasing picture than that of happy married life.
Yet how little of it we see! How the newspapers dish up to us in strong
words the misery, despair, wretchedness, infidelity and deceit of the
divorce court. How it stares at us from the desolate fireside of friend
and acquaintance; is hinted at or suppressed by the records of the
Coroner's office; leers at us from the sumptuous mansion of the
affluent; lurks in the humble cottage of the mechanic. How sad the
contrast between the home where nestle happiness, love, contentment,
offspring; and the abode of suspicion, deceit, infidelity or barrenness.

And yet men and women are being married every day, every hour--ay, every
minute. Men and women incompatible physically, mentally, morally--urged
on by lust, cupidity, love; to escape unhappy homes; to hide sad
sins--for a thousand reasons, some good, many bad--are constantly
marrying.

A man selects a wife less carefully than he would a horse; a woman
yields herself, her life, her happiness, blindly, unreasoningly, to a
man of whom she knows nothing. A man better fitted for the hospital, the
infirmary, or the insane asylum, enters the bonds of wedlock with never
a thought of the consequences; with never a care as to whether he will
wreck his own life and happiness or that of the innocent girl he is
deceiving; with never a heed of the ill-starred, diseased, puny or
idiotic progeny his act may bring into being, a burden to the community,
a curse to himself and a constant reminder of the parent's
foolhardiness--ay, even crime!

No man who is affected with any form of Sexual or Venereal Disease
should for a single instant even think of +marriage+ until every +trace+
of his +weakness+ or +disease+ has disappeared. In these days of medical
advance in this special field, there is no excuse for such action. There
are few--very few--cases of Seminal Weakness and Impotency that cannot
now be cured. Of course, here as elsewhere, there are traps and humbugs,
quacks and charlatans, false theories and empty moralizing; but there
is also truth and knowledge, hope and certainty for such as are
sufficiently in earnest to search for them. Prof. Civiale, by his
indomitable perseverance, thorough study and experiment, and final
conclusions and discoveries, has placed the means of a perfect
restoration to full mental, bodily and sexual vigor within the reach of
all, and no man has any right now to enter either blindly or wilfully
into so sacred and important a relationship as marriage, and to lower
and stultify its ends by blighting the happiness of a fair young wife,
exhausting his own vitality in the vain attempt to have offspring, or in
having such as shall be a curse to him through life.

There are those (let it be hoped they are really honest in their
ignorance) who look upon marriage as the only real cure for Seminal
Weaknesses. Even if it were a fact that the marital relations did
accomplish such a result (and they never do, as bear witness the
thousands who are to-day weak, exhausted, ex-sanguinated, unhappy,
nerveless, hopeless wrecks, who are cursing the ignorant pretenders
who gave this false--this fatal advice); even if such a result was a
certainty, what right has any man to besmirch and soil the purity of a
happy and innocent maiden for such a purpose? By what law of humanity
are woman's hopes and happiness to be hazarded on so fragile a basis,
her bark of life to be launched into a pool of such sickening
bestiality? Such marriages bear and are bearing deadly fruit before our
eyes day by day, in infidelity, abandonment, suicide, insanity, crime
and prostitution--in disease and misery, even to the third and fourth
generation.


A SPECIAL SET OF PRE-MARITAL (Before Marriage) REMEDIES.

No more delicate or wonderful piece of mechanism, no more grandly
conceived and wonderfully perfected bit of God's handicraft is to be
found than the Male and Female Sexual Organs. It is a wonder to those
who have made these parts (with their elastic vessels, cavernous
sinuses, network of nervous ganglia and fibrillæ, chain of lymphatics,
periodical ovulation, timed pubescence, and perfected, co-ordinate
functions) a study, that they stand abuse and excess so well; that
the fierce blasts of lust and passion that sear and scorch them and
well-nigh dry up their fountain springs of vitality and fecundity, do
not wholly destroy or hopelessly disarrange their delicate tissues and
functions.

The first few years of married life, even to a healthy man, are fraught
with dangers he knows nothing of. How much more then is the sufferer
from a present or even a former Seminal Weakness in danger.

No man, be he ever so healthy, ever so conscious of purity and freedom
from abuse, should enter the marital state without preparing for the
strain naturally to be expected. As the voice, skin, hair, manner and
morals of the youth change at the period of puberty (when the sexual
power is first developed--when he first becomes a man), so does the
system, mental and moral, change when he enters the bonds of matrimony.
If at puberty new diseases are prone to show themselves and old ones to
be outgrown, so at marriage a like change must be at least expected, and
he who blindly or thoughtlessly hazards a leap in the dark is foolish,
or rather foolhardy.


A SPECIAL COURSE OF NERVE AND SEXUAL TONICS.

Especially for the use of young men who have endangered or injured
their sexual power by abuse in early years, and for older men who have
exhausted themselves by later excesses. +Prof. Civiale+ was wont (very
wisely, we know from actual experience) to prescribe, for a few months
before marriage, a +Special Tonic and Strengthening Marital Course of
Remedies+, having three distinct ends in view, viz.:

(a) The strengthening, toning up and fortifying of the general system,
nerves and brain, against the unusual call soon to be made upon them;

(b) The strengthening, toning up and fortifying of the Sexual Nerves,
Ducts, Ganglia, Vesicles and Testes, against the strain soon to be
applied to them, and by this and the preceding means putting the
individual in the very best and most favorable condition for the
production of strong, healthy, robust and creditable offspring; and

(c) The steady and perfect eradication from the system, by every pore
and viaduct, of all poisonous, contagious, venereal or other material
that might in any way endanger the perfectly normal (healthy and
strong) condition of parent or offspring above spoken of. Through early
abuse, excesses, exposure, neglect, carelessness, imperfect sanitary
conditions, wrong methods of living, immoral practices, etc., the blood
and liver are liable, even though the skin be clear and the cheeks rosy,
to harbor some poisonous humors that might be transmitted to the wife or
offspring--poor innocents, too often made to suffer pitiably for the
vices or thoughtlessness of the father.

Every man about to marry owes this cleansing, purification and
strengthening of the system general and the system sexual, to his wife,
his fellow men and to himself.




_CHAPTER VIII._

THE CIVIALE URETHRAL TREATMENT.

For the Radical and Lasting Cure of all Diseases of the Sexual and
Urinary Organs. Its Mode of Operation, Application and Advantages.


The Civialè Treatment, by means of quickly melting _medicated_ Crayons
that are _easily_ and _painlessly_ inserted into the urethra (or urine
channel), and thus melt and run down over the irritated, inflamed or
strictured parts, the congested Prostate Gland, and into the orifices of
the Seminal Ducts, is the most successful treatment ever brought forward
for these diseases, and it has met with just appreciation, for it has
performed radical cures in some of the most serious and distressing
cases. Some of the advantages may be briefly summed up as follows:

1. It combines local and direct medication of the diseased parts of
the urethra, seminal ducts and vesicles, as well as of the Generative
Nerves, by means of Urethral Crayons, with judicious invigoration of the
general Digestive, Nervous, Mental and Circulatory Systems, by means of
Stomach Remedies, thus attacking the complaint from all sides.

2. The Civiale Urethral Crayons are easily introduced, melt rapidly,
medicate the entire canal, never give the slightest pain, never stain
the clothing, are rapid, pleasant and cleanly in their action, could be
used by a child without danger of injury, are perfectly soft and
flexible, and give uniform satisfaction.

3. They need be used but once, or, at the most, twice daily.

4. The good results of the treatment are apparent within the first five
or ten days.

5. Their price is so reasonable as to place them within the reach of
all.

6. They may be used to cure gleet, stricture and prostatitis, when
complicating Spermatorrhoea or Impotence.

7. They never decompose or lose their strength.

8. They are absolutely free from minerals, mercurials, caustics or
irritants.

9. They will do precisely what and all that is claimed for them.

+Civiale's+ knowledge of the anatomy, physiology and pathology of the
Genito-Urinary (Sexual and Urinary) organs, especially fitted him to
study and investigate this subject. It did not take him long to perceive
that +Lallemand's+ idea that the deep urethra, where the seminal ducts
open into it, was the real seat of the disease in both +Spermatorrhoea+
and +Impotence+, was the true and correct one, and therefore, that any
plan of treatment, to be successful, must look to allaying and healing
the inflammation, congestion or ulceration of the urethra at the neck of
the bladder, and stopping the losses.

He reasoned that when the inflammation, irritation and spasm of these
parts, and of the seminal ducts, was relieved, the drain of the vital
fluid would cease, the dilated mouths of the ducts contract, the vital
fluid become thicker and healthier, the organs increase to natural size,
and the distressing nervous symptoms, oftentimes dangerous to life or
reason, cease to trouble the patient.

  {Illustration: Fig. 7.
  Exact Size and Shape of a +Civiale Soluble Urethral Crayon+.
  (Inserted into canal of organ.)}

These Crayons shown here are small, soft, smooth, perfectly flexible,
and dissolve as soon as they are pushed into the urethral canal, thus
bringing the remedies directly in contact with the ulcerated and eroded
parts, it even running down the ducts into the seminal vesicles
themselves.

The growth, vigor and future prosperity of every nation depend upon the
strength and energy of its young men, and if the places of the robust
and healthy are to be filled by effeminate, weakened, nervous and
physically drained youths, such as the terrible vice of masturbation
is yearly giving us, the results cannot be other than disastrous. The
advice, warning and guidance of parents and guardians must be looked to
for prevention; the method and remedies of +Lallemand+ and +Civiale+ for
a cure.


A GUARANTEED ASSURANCE.

There are some persons who, from having used various forms of medicated
bougies--having had sounds, catheters and bougies roughly passed upon
them by unskillful persons--or merely from an indistinct belief, based
upon hearsay or tradition, feel some hesitancy about passing anything
into the organ for fear that it may do harm, cause pain, or give rise to
stricture.

The majority of these timid people have got this idea from hearing
it said that stricture and inflammation have often been caused by
gonorrhoea (clap) injections, and they therefore have the idea that
anything put into the urethra will do harm. There is not the slightest
doubt but that strong injections of nitrate of silver, zinc, copper,
carbolic acid and the like (of which these injections are usually made)
have, in many instances, caused severe inflammation and, eventually,
stricture.

But that is no reason why proper and absolutely unirritating and bland
medicines, such as those in the +Civiale Crayons+, should do this--and
they don't do it. Make up a strong injection of zinc, copper, &c., and
take a swallow of it. It will burn and pain your mouth and throat, make
you hoarse, and for days afterward you will find it painful to swallow.
Put a troche or lozenge, properly medicated for the purpose, into your
mouth, and, instead of causing pain, irritation and difficulty in
swallowing, it will relieve these symptoms if they exist, cool and calm
the membrane, soothe the irritation, and give tone and strength to the
vocal chords.

So it is with the CIVIALE SOLUBLE CRAYONS.

(1.) They are wholly unlike any caustic, metallic or irritating
injection.

(2.) They do not contain a grain of any mineral, caustic or irritant of
any kind.

(3.) Their ingredients are purely vegetable.

(4.) They soothe, calm and allay irritation, and give strength and tone
to the mucous membrane, Seminal Ducts, Generative Nerves and Prostate
Gland.

(5.) They do not cause stricture, but they cure it if it exists.

(6.) Allow one to dissolve in the mouth, eye, ear, nose, or, in fact
anywhere. and they will be found to possess only soothing and healing
properties.

(7.) They can be inserted into the penis without the slightest trouble,
and, melting rapidly and easily, flow down in a bland, soothing, healing
and strength and life-giving stream, over the diseased parts.

These Crayons have been in constant use in Paris for the past 25
years, and have never yet, and never will, cause the slightest pain or
irritation. Patients may rest assured, therefore, that in using these
standard French Remedies they are absolutely protected, and need not
feel the slightest degree of fear. Indeed, so well established is this
fact that we are willing to pay $1,000 (one thousand dollars) to any
person or persons who can cite a single instance when the Civiale
Crayons have ever done the slightest harm.

The disease is in the Urethra or Urine Channel, whether it be
Spermatorrhoe, Impotence, Prostatitis or gleet, and in order to effect
a lasting cure, the remedies must be applied directly to the diseased
membrane. In nine cases out of ten, Spasmodic Stricture already exists
and must be cured before the person can get well, and the only way to
cure it is to apply the medicines directly to it.

It would be as silly for a man with an ulcer on his leg, or a crushed
finger, to expect to cure it by taking drugs by the stomach and not
applying proper lotions and salves directly to it, as to try to cure
seminal disease or weakness without going right to the spot, as can be
done by the use of the elegant and harmless Crayons of Civiale.

It was by establishing the fact of local disease and a local remedy
clearly and distinctly, upon both physiological and pathological
grounds and data, that +Lallemand+ and +Civiale+ gained such world-wide
reputation. And it was the discovery of not only the proper remedies,
but an elegant and perfect means of applying them directly to the very
seat and root of the disease, that has made the Civiale Method so justly
famous, and has crowned its use with such undoubted success in this
country, even in cases where every other plan and agent had failed.


A REASONABLE AND HONEST GUARANTEE.

We feel no hesitation whatever in guaranteeing a perfect and permanent
cure of Spermatorrhoea, Impotence, Debility, &c., &c., in any case
wherein our Medical Director decides that a cure is possible by any
means, if the patient will use reasonable care and diligence in pursuing
the treatment, and this is not hard or tiresome; on the contrary, it is
easy, simple and direct.

We say "in any case wherein our Medical Director decides that a cure is
possible by any means," and we say it with a purpose, for it is our aim
and desire, at all times, to be perfectly frank and honest with those
who consult us. There are cases that no remedy, be it ever so good, can
cure, and when such a one occurs in our practice, we endeavor to show
the patient his exact condition, and not (as is so often done) try to
persuade him to purchase remedies that we know will do him no good, or,
at least, be but an experiment. So, in consulting our Physicians, you
may be sure of at least an honest opinion, in exact conformity with the
facts in your case.




_CHAPTER IX._

TREATMENT.

The Different Forms of Remedies for Different Forms of Sexual and
Urinary Diseases.


These Crayons are put up in packages, each of which will last one month.
A single package is ordinarily sufficient for mild cases of either
Spermatorrhoea or Impotence. From two to three packages are required
for chronic, severe or obstinate cases, or where the person is much
debilitated or advanced in years. There are five kinds:

      No. 1--For Spermatorrhoea and Chronic Debility.
      No. 2--For Impotence or Lost Power.
      No. 3--For Urinary, Kidney, Bladder or Prostate Troubles.
      No. 4--For Gonorrhoea.
      No. 5--For Gleet and Stricture (of Venereal Origin).
Also: No. 6--A Before-Marriage Tonic Course.
      No. 7--A Developing Lotion for Weak and Wasted Organs.

The following are the main symptoms of each class, with the kind of
course they usually call for. If the patient has the symptoms of both
classes he is evidently in an advanced stage, and needs both courses.


SPECIAL CAUTION.

The reader is warned against confounding the CIVIALE URETHRAL CRAYONS
with the American Medicated Bougies, Injections, Pastilles, and the
like. The disease is really seated in the Urethra (urine canal), and
can be easily and painlessly medicated, and certainly cured, by means of
the CIVIALE CRAYONS.

  {Illustration: Fig. 8.

SPECIAL NOTE.--It is a rare thing for any one patient to have all these
symptoms, and some may have some not here mentioned, but it is important
to know just which they do have. Persons desiring treatment will,
therefore, please tear out the proper page, and having crossed out such
symptoms as they do not have, return it to us for the consideration of
our physician. To save delay, it is best in ordinarily severe cases to
send the price of one course, and leave the selection to our physician's
discretion. When less is needed than what is paid for, the balance due
the patient will be returned to him with the necessary medicine.


CIVIALE'S URETHRAL CRAYONS.

_COURSE No. 2._

_For Impotence, Failing or Lost Strength and Vigor of the Generative
Organs, Sterility, etc., etc._

SYMPTOMS.--(Impotence may arise without any previous symptoms of

brick-dust deposit, and other sediments, Stone in the bladder, Diabetes,
Irritation and Enlargement of the Prostate Gland, Congestion and
Inflammation of the Kidneys, Bloody Urination, etc., etc. (Many cases of
Seminal Disease are due to or made worse by urinary trouble, especially
Prostatic Disease, existing at the same time. Hence, when such is the
case, it is important to treat the urinary as well as the seminal
disease in order to be certain to permanently and thoroughly cure both.
The action of the Civialè Urethral Crayons in these cases is prompt and
satisfactory. Indeed, this is the only known means of reaching and
curing Prostatic Affections.

    1 Box, $5.
    2 Boxes, $9.
    Full Course, 3 Boxes, $12.


CIVIALE'S URETHRAL CRAYONS.

_COURSE No. 4._

_For Gonorrhoea._

One box a certain cure. Prompt, painless, and leaves no stricture.
Constantly used in _L'Hopital du Midi_ and _L'Hopital Lourcine_, the two
great venereal disease hospitals of Paris--the one for males, the other
for females--as well as in the others.

    $5 Per Box.


CIVIALE'S URETHRAL CRAYONS.

_COURSE No. 5._

_For Gleet and Stricture (When the result of Venereal Disease)._

The formula used in preparing these Urethral Crayons is one of the
finest the great +Civiale+ conceived. Repeated trials and modifications
finally ended in an almost perfect remedy. Gleet or obstinate milky
discharge or oozing of from two to twelve years' standing yielded
painlessly and permanently to their use. Stricture, too, even when
organic, if not so far advanced as to interfere seriously with
urination, yielded kindly to this treatment, being gradually dissolved
and absorbed until, at last, the canal was left free and clear, and all
the symptoms of urinary irritation had disappeared. Testimony from Dr.
Lorey, Interne at the _Hopital du Midi_, will give some idea of the
popularity of this form of treatment in Paris. With them he cured eighty
consecutive cases of Chronic Gleet.

    $5 Per Box.
    2 Boxes, $8.
    3 Boxes, $10.


_COURSE No. 6._

_CIVIALE'S PRE-MARITAL TONIC COURSE._

This is the course we have already adverted to under the head of
marriage, and we believe that enough was there said to make plain both
its object and application. This, unlike the preceding courses, is, so
to speak, a mixed one, consisting of a combination of (1) Tonics and
Sexual Nervines to be taken by the mouth; (2) A Specially Prepared
Course of Crayons (tonic, anti-spasmodic and detergent), to be used
in the urethra, and (3) a lotion or application which, by being gently
applied to the parts once a day with a sponge, soft cloth or the hand,
adds greatly to the strength and erectile power, as well as the tone,
development and vigor of the testicles.

These are put up under the strict personal supervision of our head
chemist, Mr. Du Bell, and are exactly in accordance with the formlæ and
instructions of the late Prof. Civiale.

  Price per Set, $25.

This Course may be used alone or in connection with any of the other
Courses. No man (or woman either) could be injured by it, and many weak
and impotent sufferers will find in its use health, strength and bodily
and mental vigor.

In some instances the Tonic Regulator and Lotion part of this Course are
advisable without the Crayons, and hence we quote their price
separately.

    Tonic Regulator, $10.
    Lotio Fortior, $5.

  {Illustration: DR. LOREY,
  Interne at l'Hopital du Midi, Paris.}


_CIVIALE'S TONIC-REGULATOR._

Civialé's Tonic-Regulator is all that its name indicates and much more
besides. It is composed of Tonics, Nervines, Bitters, Laxatives, Nerve
Foods, Cholagogues (acting on the Liver), Diuretics and Diaphoretics
(remedies acting on the Kidneys and Skin and thereby increasing their
secretions and cleansing and purifying the Blood), Digestives, etc.,
etc., etc. It will thus be seen that a more complete and uniform General
Tonic-Regulator could not be devised, for it acts upon the Brain, Mind,
Nervous System, Digestive Organs, Spleen and Pancreas, the Bowels
(keeping them in a healthy and regular manner only--not purging or
weakening), upon the Heart, Lungs, Skin, Blood and Kidneys.

So skillfully is the combination made that no one ingredient interferes
with the other, but on the contrary each seems to vie with the other in
building up and renovating a shattered, weakened and disordered system.

Bilious, soggy, sleepy men, with aching heads, foul breaths, bad tasting
mouths on rising, clogged secretions, sense of inability to exertion,
furred or yellow tongues, and the like, absolutely need the
Tonic-Regulator, and not Blue Mass or Anti-Bilious Pills. Weak, nervous,
spiritless, exhausted, debilitated, pale, ambitionless, easily tired,
prone to become short of breath and have pain in side on running, who
find it hard to get sleep, are restless, brood over their troubles, real
or imaginary, start at loud noises or sudden jars, perspire too easily,
flush too readily, are not rested by sleep, and who are neuralgic,
certainly need the Tonic-Regulator, and will find it rapid in action
and very pleasant in its results. Health, strength, vigor, rosy cheeks,
elastic step, cheery voice, zest and happiness, hope and ambition, hardy
flesh and good ruddy blood, made by a perfect digestion of strong foods,
will certainly follow, and as they come, all the old myths and phantoms,
the melancholy, dread and brooding will disappear like unhealthy nightly
vapors before the sun.

Men, young or old, who have let business cares and worries, mental
trouble, family jars, overwork and constant brain wear and tear,
confinement, or long hours in unhealthy offices, lack of exercise,
too rapid bolting of food, and the like, ruin their previously good
constitutions; or those who, through youthful abuses committed in
ignorance and repented so bitterly, or later excesses from unbridled
passions, have drained their vitality, established a condition of sexual
atony (_a_, without; _tonos_, tone or strength or vigor), or done
serious harm to their nervous systems, brains or minds, will find the
very Vital Restorative and Special Generative Tonic they need the most
in Civiale's Tonic-Regulator.

It does not do one thing; it does many. While it throws open one door to
let health, strength and vigor enter, it opens others for poisonous
secretions, blood impurities and waste products to escape. It not only
makes the blood purer and richer, but it strengthens the organ (the
heart) that pumps it everywhere throughout the system. It not only
builds up and rejuvenates the general system, but it brings vernal
strength and power to the weakened and debilitated organs.

It was here that Civiale made Common Sense and Medical Science join
hands. (a) With his Medicated Urethral Crayons he healed and
strengthened the organs of Generation by direct local application.
(b) While with the Tonic-Regulator he sent his powerful yet harmless
emissaries (Tonics, Digestives, Cholagogues, Nervines and Nerve Foods,
Laxatives, Diuretics, etc., etc.) into the system, by the stomach, with
the food, thus guaranteeing their entrance into the blood which carried
them to every nerve fibre and tissue and attacked the disease on every
side.

This is why this double treatment, intelligently carried out, cannot
fail to rebuild the most debilitated and exhausted constitution and
check the most serious drains and losses.


_COURSE No. 7._

_DEVELOPMENTAL LOTION._

As has already been stated, in some persons Seminal Disease and
Losses of Vital Fluid lead to a wasting away, shrinking or dwindling
of the Generative Organs. It exists in others from birth, and is in
no way connected with Seminal Disease. Whichever be the case, it is
nevertheless true that a wasted or deformed part of the body, be it arm,
leg or what not, cannot in this condition be expected to perform its
function in a natural, vigorous and healthy manner.

There is a great deal of ignorance upon this subject--ignorance that
interferes greatly with the full and proper treatment of cases of
Seminal weakness. Many sufferers from Seminal Disease and Impotence seem
to think that just as soon as the losses or emissions are stopped, or
erectile power returns, the parts will begin to grow and develop, and
soon be restored to natural size and proportions. This is not so. In
some few instances it does occur, but in the large majority it does not.

It is therefore necessary in these cases to take special measures to
fully and perfectly develop the defective parts, and it can only be
done by giving a new start to growth and circulation to the nervous and
nutritive centres of these parts. A breast, a limb, a hand, indeed any
part of the human body, especially in persons not past fifty years of
age, can be enlarged and developed, and so, too, can the sexual organs.

_The Developmental Lotion_ that has been in use for many years, is a
local application (viz., applied directly to the organs), and acts by
stimulating growth, circulation and nutrition. It is cleanly, easily
applied, rapid and satisfactory in its results, and we guarantee that
it will give uniform satisfaction in all cases where our Board of
Consulting Physicians recommend the case as favorable for it.

    PRICE OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL LOTION, { Strongest,  $15.
                                       { Less strong, 10.

It is put up in quantity sufficient to accomplish a full and perfect
development. Should more than is at first sent be needed to complete
the development, we will furnish it at half-price. Full instructions
accompany it.

It should be used in connection with the remedies for Impotency or
Spermatorrhoea in every case where the organs are wasted. Its effects
in such cases are wonderful and the results very gratifying.

_CHAPTER XI._

VARICOCELE.

VARICOSE TESTICLE, OR VARICOCELE.

A very Common Disease Amongst Men and Boys, and one that has a very
serious effect In Weakening the Sexual Powers, causing Emissions and
Losses, and Preventing a Thorough and Permanent Cure of these
Complaints.

Varicocele (from the Greek, pronounced Var-i-ko-seal, accent on either
Var or seal) is a condition of bagging, bunching, bulging or twisting
of the veins in the scrotum (bag or testicle sac.) It is most commonly
found on the left side of the bag, but sometimes is to be seen on both
sides. Usually the scrotum is bulged out on the side and sometimes hangs
very low, so long and twisted are the veins. To the touch the veins feel
like a bunch of angle-worms. In some cases they can be seen knotted and
swollen through the thin skin of the bag.

  {Illustration: Fig. 9.

  dotted outline, showing how and where the pressure is properly
  exerted. When the veins in the groin are thus affected, we have what
  is known as +Varicocele of the Cord+. On the left side, the Cradle
  and Compressor is shown in place.}


A HIDDEN DANGER.

In cases of Varicocele of the Cord (one of the most dangerous of all
forms), the veins in the bag are not affected, the trouble being mostly
in the groin (in the canal through which the veins run), where the
swollen and knotted veins press upon and seriously injure the cord,
preventing the free flow of Vital Fluid, and thereby causing Impotence,
Wasting of the Testicles, etc. A dull, heavy, aching or dragging pain in
the groin, back or legs, is about the only symptom.

The great danger of this form of Varicocele lies in the fact that
thousands of young men are going about to-day not knowing that they have
the disease; not knowing that a persistent evil is nestling in this
little canal, gnawing at their vitals, and slowly but surely undermining
and destroying their sexual vigor and manhood.

We know this to be so because we are daily being consulted by men of
different ages, who, until our physician, in the course of the
examination, showed it to them, _never suspected its existence_. Many
of these men had been "doctoring" for years for seminal weakness and the
like, with varying success, never being quite cured, or, if cured, soon
relapsing--all because a Varicocele of the Cord existed unsuspected and
therefore untreated.

  {Illustration: Fig. 12.
  SIDE VIEW.
  Showing Bell Spring, Pad and Pubic Shield.}


CAUSES.--The causes of this condition of the veins of the bag are very
numerous. Some of the most important are Masturbation or excess, causing
weakening of all the parts, the veins included; Falls, Blows, Strains,
Excessive Horseback and Bicycle Riding, Running, Jumping, Mumps going
to the Testicles, Gonorrhoeal Inflammation settling there, Kick in the
Groin, Wearing of Improper Trusses, etc., etc. Masturbation is one of
the most common of all the causes. In many instances, even if it does
not _directly_ cause the complaint, it weakens the parts, so that blows,
strains, etc., that in others would not produce any particular trouble,
readily cause it in these persons.

SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms are not many unless it has caused seminal
weakness and lost vitality, in which case all the symptoms of these
complaints may really be attributed to the Varicocele. Pains in the
Groin, Limbs and Back; a sense of weight or dragging; Neuralgia of the
Testicles, Fetid Perspiration; Itching and peculiar sensations in the
Skin of the Bag; Chafing in warm weather; easy tiring under rapid
walking or running, are not uncommon. In some very bad cases, however,
none of these symptoms, or only a few, are present. Why, we cannot say.

PROGNOSIS.--In itself this disease is not dangerous. It is from the fact
that the veins may go on bulging until an enormous swelling is produced
(we have seen cases where the bag hung as low as the knee and was nearly
as large around as a man's arm); that the testicles may be entirely
wasted away, and that it may cause Spermatorrhoea, Lost Manhood, Total
Impotence, &c., &c., constitute its greatest gravity.

TREATMENT.--Cutting and tying operations are exceedingly dangerous,
having frequently caused death; and even if successful, the testicles,
having their blood supply thus entirely cut off, waste away, and
Impotence certainly results. Prof. Chevillot, the great French surgeon,
was assassinated by a patient, in whose case he tied the veins on both
sides for a double Varicocele. Becoming totally impotent, on the very
eve of his marriage with a beautiful and accomplished young lady, this
man became desperate and attempted the surgeon's life.

To effect a cure, the following obstacles must be overcome:

_Weakness and bulging of the walls of the veins._

_Weakness and relaxation of the dartos muscle of the scrotum._

_Over-clogging and stagnation of blood in the veins._

_Healing and strengthening of the ruptured and relaxed valves of the
veins._

_Relief of the pressure and weight of the column of blood from above._

Suspensory Bandages are good, because they act as supports.

Astringent and Tonic Washes are good, because they strengthen the
weakened veins and muscles and heal the relaxed valves.

Proper Trusses are good, because they break the great pressure of the
blood from above, and act as do the valves in the veins in the groin in
health. Also, because they act directly on the disease in cases of
Varicocele of the Cord.

But neither one alone will cure a really serious case of Varicocele.
Combine them, however, properly and scientifically, so that you have the
practical outcome of these three sound principles of cure in the one
appliance, and


ANY CASE, NO MATTER HOW SEVERE OR HOW OLD, CAN BE PERMANENTLY AND
PAINLESSLY CURED.

Such a perfect and practical combination is to be found in the Elastic
self-adjusting and adjustable Cradle and Compressor, which has succeeded
in curing many very serious and (apparently) hopeless cases. Patented
and thoroughly protected from all infringements and imitations (and many
would-be ones, seeing our success and recognizing the merits of the
Cradle-Compressor, have lately sprung up), both in this country and
Europe, there is nothing like it. It combines all the good points of all
previous instruments, and being easy to wear, rapid and pleasing in its
results, and certain in its effects, is the only rational means for
radically curing this disease.

Briefly: It consists of a very light and elastic triangle of tempered
steel bands, that rests on the front of the abdomen, and is held in
place by a soft silk-elastic waist-band. In each of the slanting arms of
the triangle are small holes that admit the central pivot of a bell-pad,
having a central spring, and so adjusted that it adapts itself to every
movement of the body without being misplaced. By means of a thumb-screw
and the perforations, it (the spring bell-pad) can be set at any point
in the groin, and can be changed from day to day and hour to hour.

  {Illustration: Fig. 13.
  INSTRUMENT ON BODY.
  _a. a._ Transverse Steel Band; _b. b._ Elastic Waist Belt;
  _c. d._ Metallic Arms, perforated to permit change of pad pressure;
  _e._ Pubic Shield to which Elastic Cradle is attached; _f._ Bell
  Spring Pad.}

By means of pivotal joints at the angles, the appliance can be made
to fit any one perfectly; moreover, by means of the metallic shoulder
below, the arms can be thrown into any lateral variation of the groin
line.

We thus are able to obtain all the marked benefits of a truss without
any of its drawbacks; and that special disadvantage, steady and
wearisome pressure at one point, is wholly obviated. The whole appliance
is held in place below by means of perineal tubular rubber bands that
connect with the waist-belt behind.

Attached to the metallic shoulder below is the Elastic, Glove-Fitting,
Self-Adjusting Testicle-Cradle, by means of which not only are the
testicles perfectly supported and rested, but by the sheet-rubber lining
and the elastic tie bands, a constant, easy and perfectly painless
elastic pressure is kept up on the dilated and sagging veins, which are
thereby emptied of their unhealthy and stagnated blood and allowed to
regain their tone, strength and contractility.

By means of the elastic bands it is easy to regulate the amount of
pressure, thereby constantly adapting it to the improvement that is
steadily taking place.

The compression is so uniform, yet so elastic, that it is absolutely
painless, and no motion of the body, however violent, can disarrange it.
This, and the fact that the blood can enter and leave the testicle with
perfect freedom, constitute some of its most marked advantages over the
Truss.

Moreover, the wearer always feels a sense of rest and relief while
wearing the Elastic Cradle-Compressor, and from the first day the
symptoms of weakness and impotence improve. Being made in different
sizes and shapes, and of the most durable yet softest silk, and powerful
yet yielding elastic, they will wear perfectly until long after the
Varicocele has entirely disappeared.

While it compresses the Varicocele, forces out the blood, and allows the
veins a chance to regain their strength and proper size again, it simply
supports and keeps from injury the testicle, which at once begins to
grow larger. In addition to their curative value in Varicocele, they are
now being extensively used by the medical profession for the relief of
the pain and subduing of the inflammation of "swelled testicle;" also in
hydrocele and hæmatocele.

Being applied over the whole scrotum, they will cure a Double as readily
as a Single Varicocele.

In certain recent or simple cases the Elastic Testicle-Cradle alone will
effect a perfect cure. If the case is severe or of long standing, if it
involves the Cord, or if the sexual organs are affected, the complete
instrument should be worn.

It is beautifully made and finished, and is strong and durable, yet
light and easily worn.

The reason why Varicocele has until within the past ten or fifteen years
received so little attention is owing to the fact that up to that time
this bagging or bulging of the spermatic veins was looked upon as merely
a local affection. No one seemed to be aware of the fact that its effect
in nine cases out of ten was to produce Seminal Weakness and Loss of
Sexual Power, etc. To-day no fact is so well recognized in medicine,
although probably not so well known outside of the profession.

Then, too, until very recently, physicians either carelessly dismissed a
patient with Varicocele with the advice to "get a suspensory bandage and
wear it; the thing don't amount to anything;" or else, when the patient
became persistent in his demands for a cure, advised him that the
dangerous cutting or tying operations were the only means of relief. But
this is all changed now. Physicians have come to know something about
the disease, and means for both relief and cure are now speedy and
certain, and in no sense painful or dangerous.

It is for the purpose of stating in as plain and concise a manner as
possible all the more important facts relating to this disease, and
pointing out to such as are troubled with it, or have friends so
troubled, not only the proper manner of treatment, but also the danger
of delay, that this little treatise has been compiled. Many a man well
built and apparently healthy, yet totally bereft of manhood--in a word
Impotent--can trace his deplorable condition to a neglected Varicocele.

Nor are these the only ones who need information upon the subject.
Thousands of young men are to-day being treated for seminal troubles who
will never be cured, because they are entirely ignorant of the existence
of a Varicocele of the Cord, that most insidious and dangerous of all
forms of Varicocele, or, if aware of it, do not understand the terrible
influence it has on their Sexual Powers, and how great and persistent a
stumbling-block it will be in the way of all treatment.

It is for the benefit of all such that this little essay is intended.
For the sake of clearness we shall consider the subject under the heads
of Definition, Frequency, Causes, Dangers, Influence on Sexual Diseases,
Wasting of the Organs, Symptoms and Treatment.

_CHAPTER XII._

THE RELIABILITY OF THE CIVIALE REMEDIES,
AND THE BUSINESS STANDING AND PROBITY OF OUR AGENCY.


In previous editions of this work, we made no attempt whatever to point
out to our readers either our reputation as a medical business firm, or
proofs of the efficacy or reliability of the remedies we represent and
prescribe, supposing that any person at all familiar with the names and
reputation of Professors Lallemand and Civiale, and the honors bestowed
upon the latter by the French government, would need no such references,
etc. We find, however, that there are but few men in this country who
are as familiar as they should be with the nature and extent of
Lallemand's and Civiale's medical labors, or indeed with French Medical
History at all. We, therefore, for the benefit of such, have here
transcribed extracts from that most reliable work, _Appleton's
Cyclopedia_ (copies of which may be found in many families, and every
town and city library), from which may be learned the professional
standing and reputation of these great men.

Furthermore: Of late years there have sprung up in various parts of the
country, physicians and firms who have made it a business to prey upon
foolish young men, who took everything that was sent to them for gospel.
There are many young men (and old men, too) who do not know us, and for
their benefit we have drawn up here and submitted such proofs of our
probity, fair dealing and medical capacity, as well as of the
reliability of the Civiale Remedies, as will, we believe, carry
conviction of our truthfulness and probity to any honest man's mind.

We have always been averse to parading before the eyes of the careless,
scoffing world the sufferings of the victims of abuse or excess, even
when by doing so we might profit largely by such a course. We have a
large number of letters from persons who have been cured by this
treatment constantly on file in our office, and any sufferer really in
earnest will be gladly given permission to examine them, should he so
desire. But we certainly shall not parade such letters, written to us in
the strictest confidence and secrecy, to every reader of a treatise of
this kind, especially when we give an abundance of equally as good proof
of another kind.

_If we have always dealt fairly and with professional honor and ability
with our corresponding and office patients in the past, we certainly
shall continue to do so in the future._

First, let us call your attention to two very recent and very flattering
extracts from editorial articles that appeared in newspapers of known
standing and reputation in the city of New York, both of which articles
were wholly unsolicited by us, being the spontaneous testimony of wholly
disinterested journals.




         TESTIMONIALS AND ENDORSEMENTS

                    from the

             MEDICAL AND LAY PRESS

          Of this Country and France.


A NOTABLE MEDICAL INSTITUTION.

_From the New York TRIBUNE AND FARMER, Nov. 22, 1884._


It is a well-recognized fact by writers upon longevity that the men of
the present day, both old and young, are less manly and vigorous, less
able to resist the attacks of acute disease, and not only less likely to
produce healthy and vigorous offspring, but in the majority of instances
producing a fewer number as well as a less vigorous and robust progeny.
The ratio of births to deaths has fallen off some 12 per cent. in births
in the past fifteen years. This fact, coupled with the equally startling
consideration that the mortality of infants has increased about 11 per
cent. in the past ten years, must needs fill the mind of a lover of his
kind with dismay and alarm. Although invested and thickly hedged about
by ideas of false modesty and pseudo-propriety, in reality the whole
fabric of national and individual prosperity, health, vigor and
enjoyment, as well as the very important perpetuation of our species,
depend upon perfectly strong, healthy and vigorous procreative powers.
As an oak cannot grow from a flower seed, neither can weak, puny and
debilitated parents give birth to strong, vigorous and mentally sound
and active progeny.

The subject of Procreative Pathology deserves more careful and extended
study and observation than the majority of our physicians have
heretofore been inclined to give it. Most of them have let the more
numerous and oftentimes the more trivial cases daily coming under their
notice crowd this most serious matter from sight, and when applied to
for advice or treatment by sufferers from these disorders or debilities,
have either pooh-poohed it or have given some simple (or useless)
placebo, believing the trouble to be more imaginary than real. Is it any
wonder, then, that such patients have walked blindfold into the arms of
quacks and charlatans who profess the most tender interest in even their
minutest symptoms?

We have been led to make the foregoing remarks by what we have just
finished reading in a very interesting and able work upon this subject
recently issued from the press of the Civialè Remedial Agency, of 174
Fulton street, this city. The subject matter of this book cannot fail to
interest every man, young or old, and must prove of special interest to
men just married, and to that large class of middle-aged men who find to
their surprise and chagrin that while their bodily health is apparently
excellent, their procreative powers have prematurely declined.

The fact of the establishment in this city of an original institution
under reputable business management, each department of which is
presided over by a physician of special skill and qualifications, is
something of which every citizen should feel proud. And to judge by the
class of patients who may be found in their elegant consulting-rooms,
and the very large amount of express and mail matter they are constantly
receiving, we believe that they are appreciated.

With our magnificent hospitals, second to none in the world, our large
medical colleges and dispensaries, and the establishment of so large and
excellent an institution as the Civialè Agency, the main offices being
now transferred from Paris to this city, New York may justly claim to be
the great medical centre of the United States, and sooner or later of
the world.

We maintain now, as we have always maintained, that the surest and best
way to drive quacks and humbugs from any branch of medicine, is to have
some of our very ablest and most honorable physicians make such a branch
their specialty, and such is the course now being pursued by the Civialè
Agency.

The very fact that it takes its name from and is engaged in
manufacturing and prescribing the remedies of France's most illustrious
specialist, Prof. Jean Civialè, is by itself evidence enough of its
medical value and professional integrity. Our feelings upon these
matters, _i.e._, the great importance of their bearing upon both
individual and national vigor and prosperity, the necessity for driving
from this field of practice those quacks and humbugs who entrap the
foolish and ignorant, those cheap and worthless remedies that flood
the drug market--our feelings upon these matters are, we repeat, very
strong; and hence, when we find an institution for the treatment of
these diseases conducted upon the highest moral, medical and business
principles by men of undoubted medical and business standing and
integrity, we feel that we cannot endorse them too heartily.


The _Tribune and Farmer_, of New York city, in its current issue of
July 26th, 1884, says

"AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE."

"The propriety of devoting editorial space to the subject-matter of any
medical advertisement that may appear in our columns may be doubted by
some, and indeed, were it not for our personal knowledge of the skill
and integrity of the Medical Director of the Civialè Remedial Agency of
New York (whose advertisements will be found elsewhere in this issue),
we should deem ourselves more than guilty were we to utter a word of
endorsement as to the efficacy of their system of treating that serious
class of diseases in men which has been generically termed Nervous
Debility, and which for so many years has been, and is at present, made
the stalking-horse for impudent swindlers, quacks and impostors to palm
off worthless and often injurious compounds on their suffering
fellow-men.

"Let it be understood, then, that we know whereof we speak, and that our
object is simply to furnish those who are afflicted with such reliable
information as will enable them to determine the true character of their
disease, and the best means to be adopted for a cure.

"The method of treating diseases of the Genito-Urinary organs by means
of the urethral canal is in the first place no new-fangled experiment,
but is identical with the system which has been employed for the past
fifteen years in the leading hospitals of France, and more especially
in Paris, as the standard treatment, and one that gives uniform
satisfaction; and in the history of medical science there are perhaps no
two physicians who have done more for the alleviation of human suffering
and the cure of Sexual and Seminal Diseases than those eminent French
Surgeons, Prof. Jean Civialè and Prof. Claude Lallemand, to whose joint
studies and endeavors this system owes its origin.

"We believe, in fact, that this theory and practice of medicine is
an advance in the right direction, and we predicted, from its first
introduction in the United States some time ago, that the people would
readily see its truth and accept the wonderful benefits of its practice.
And the result has certainly borne out our prediction, for thousands of
sufferers from such ills as Impotence, Spermatorrhoea, Kidney, Liver and
Urinary troubles have been cured by these remedies."


  {Illustration: ONE VIEW OF THE HOSPITAL OF THE HOTEL DIEU, PARIS.

  This celebrated hospital of Paris, the oldest as well as the largest
  and finest in the city, covers 22,000 square metres of land, has over
  1,000 beds, and a corps of over 100 physicians on its medical and
  surgical staff. It is situated on the _Ile de la Cité_, near the
  famous church of Notre Dame. It was here that both LALLEMAND and
  CIVIALÈ studied under the celebrated DUPUYTREN, one of France's
  greatest surgeons, until, in after years, they themselves became
  sufficiently great to become its Consulting Surgeons. In France,
  honors are gained by ability alone, and not, as here, by political
  influence and wire-pulling.}

The following is a list of the French Hospitals with which Civiale and
Lallemand were connected during their lives.

HOTEL DIEU. LA PITIE. LA CHARITE. LARABOISIERE. St. ANTOINE. HOPITAL
NECKAR. HOPITAL COCHIN. HOPITAL St. LOUIS. HOPITAL Du MIDI. HOPITAL
LOURCINE. La MATERNITE. HOSPICE BICETRE.

We next give extracts from Appleton's Cyclopedia, to which reference has
already been made.

LALLEMAND, CLAUDE FRANÇOIS, a French physician, born in Metz, Jan. 26,
1790, died in Marseilles, Aug. 25, 1854. After serving as assistant
surgeon in the armies of the Empire, he studied in Paris at the Hotel
Dieu under Dupuytren, and, from 1819 to 1845, was Professor of Clinical
Surgery at Montpelier, with the exception of three years, during which
he was suspended for his liberal political expressions. His most
important work, _Recherches Anatomica Pathologiques sur l'Encephale et
ses Dependances_ (Paris, 1820-1836), established his reputation, and was
translated into many languages. In 1845 he was elected to the _Academy
of Sciences_, removed to Paris, and was consulted by patients from every
part of Europe. He bequeathed 50,000 francs to the Institute.

  {Illustration: Prof. CLAUDE F. LALLEMAND}

CIVIALÈ, JEAN, a French surgeon, the originator of the operation of
Lithotrity, born near Thiezac, Auvergne, 1792, died in Paris, June 13,
1867. At a very early age, while a pupil of Dupuytren at the _Hotel
Dieu_ hospital in Paris, his attention is said to have been attracted
to the subject of his future discovery; and, after many years of
perseverance, he succeeded in perfecting and introducing to the
profession his new operation of lithotrity. Before that time the only
means was the serious and often dangerous operation of lithotomy (SEE
STONE). He was the teacher of several generations of lithotriptists,
became a member of the MEDICAL ACADEMY, and an officer of the LEGION OF
HONOR. His principal publications are: _De la Lithotritie, ou brolement
de la pierre_, (_Paris_), 1827); _Lettres sur la Lithotritie, &c._
(1827); _Traite pratique et historique de la Lithotritie_ (1847);
_Resultats Cliniques de la Lithotritie pendent les Annes_ 1860-64
(1865). --[_Appleton's Cyclopedia, vol. iv, p. 618._

A CHARACTERISTIC LETTER.

(For once we transgress our rule--never to put a debility patient's
letter in print unless the patient urges us to do so--and do it at the
request of our Medical Chief of Staff, and with the patient's full
consent. The name, however, we omit, simply stating that should any
intending patient desire to come and see or send some friend living in
the city, to see and verify that letter and many more like it, we shall
be most happy to oblige them.)

      RODNEY, MISS., August 14, 1884.

_Dear Sirs:_--My course of treatment being almost all used, I feel it
my duty to state to you my present condition, and I can say without
hesitation that I am almost a new man, and I thank God that improvement
has been so thorough and rapid, may it be but lasting. Sexual desire is
now perfect, erections are perfect, emissions come at the right time,
oozing of vital fluid at stools and in the urine has stopped, I rest
well at night with the exception I shall state further on, appetite
is good and digestion almost perfect. I can now approach the presence
of the opposite sex with some satisfaction to myself; ambition is
returning, and in fact a whole new lease of life seems suddenly to have
been allotted to me. The varicocele has almost disappeared. I cannot say
enough in praise for this beautiful little appliance, "the Cradle
Compressor." Now, if it were not for the urinary disorder which still
remains, I should call myself well; that this remains, however, is no
fault of the crayons, and could the Course No. 3 have reached me
undamaged by heat, as did the Course No. 2, I have not the least doubt I
should now be well. The symptoms of this disorder, still present, are
dreams at night, not nervous ones as before, but still unpleasant;
mucous oozing after straining, also in the morning on rising I find the
lips of organ glued, and on forcing apart a drop of this mucous fluid
makes its appearance. I have no doubt whatever that had crayons reached
me perfectly, this disorder would have been conquered same as the other.
Now, in your little circular you guarantee a cure "in all cases wherein
your Medical Examiner decides a cure is possible." Now this certainly
holds good in my case. Please let me know what you are willing to do
about the matter, for I certainly need another course of No. 3 crayons,
and if you would furnish them in place of the ones destroyed in transit,
I should consider your guarantee fulfilled. The course you sent me last
could not be used at all; they were ten times worse than the first ones,
and I only wasted them in trying to use same. However, do not send any
crayons till you hear from me, and I think the weather cool enough, as
they would only be wasted again. Could you furnish me, and at what
price, a suspensory, such as you would recommend, if not, where could
I get one? I think it advisable to wear one after laying aside the
Compressor, as I have to be on my feet all the time.

Please excuse encroachment on your time and believe me ever,

      Yours very truly,      ---- SINGER.


DOUBLE VARICOCELE AND SPERMATORRHOEA RADICALLY CURED.

(These letters are published at the patient's own request, and he will
be most happy to correspond with any earnest and honest inquirer).


"TIRED OF HUMBUGGING."

      "ISLIP, Suffolk County, N.Y.

"_Manager of the Civiale Remedial Agency,_
      "174 Fulton street, New York.

"_Dear Sir:_--My attention has been several times called to your method
of curing Varicocele of the Bag without any cutting or tying, and I am
now going to describe my case to you, and get your idea whether you can
cure me or not. I would have done this long ago if I hadn't been afraid
of being humbugged, as I often have been by doctors and men who said
they could cure me right off without any pain or trouble. But they all
fooled me out of my money, and that's all. But I'm going to try once
more, and please tell me if you think my case is too bad for your
Compress and Cradle.

"I'm pretty badly off I know, but it seems to me that this thing ought
to be able to be cured by some one. This is how mine was. Eight or nine
years ago I fell from the rigging of a schooner, and was laid up for
nearly sixteen weeks with a broken thigh. I also had both testicles
terribly sore and swollen, and it was a long time after my leg got well
before I was able to walk, the pain in the groin, testicles and small of
my back was so bad. Sometimes, even when I was sitting quiet, it would
cut me like the stab of a knife. The first I noticed of the Varicocele
was one day when I was taking a bath I saw there was a sort of bulging
there, and come to notice it closer, it felt just like a bunch of
angle worms all twisted together. I tried cold water to it and wore a
suspension bag for a long time, but it didn't do much good. At first it
didn't trouble me much in winter, but was bad in summer. Now it's bad
all the time, and I don't believe I could walk half a mile without I
wore a supporter.

"I have tried most everything I ever heard of, but it's no use. Some of
the things helped me for a while, but they didn't last, and now I'm
pretty well discouraged, for I don't dare have it operated on; not so
much that I'm afraid of the pain, but because a young man I knew went to
a hospital in New York to be operated on, and died, because the veins
got inflamed from the cutting and tying.

"I am willing to pay any one a fair price for curing me, because as I
am now I can't do a fair day's work, and my testes are wasting away very
fast. But I don't want any more humbugging, and if you treat me, you
have got to give me good proofs that you can do as you say."

      "Truly yours,      D. L. B.

"I forgot to say that my Varicocele is on _both_ sides, but the left
side is much the worse. It is twice as bulgy as the other."


"JUST AS REPRESENTED."

      "ISLIP, N.Y.

"_Dear Sir:_--I went to the depot night before last and got the package
all right, and when I got up yesterday morning, bathed as the circular
said, and put the Cradle and Compressor on me. I write to tell you how
pleased I am. I always felt sure some one would find a cure for this
thing, and believe I've got hold of the right thing at last, though I'm
not going to crow this time till I'm part way out of the woods at least.

"Any way, I'm satisfied so far. The appliance is just what it was
represented, and I find that it fits me to a t, and is the most easy and
comfortable thing I ever wore. I haven't had a bit of pain since I put
it on yesterday morning, and I have done some hard work these two days,
purposely twisting and wrenching my body about to see if I would get it
out of place.

"So far it is all right, and I am very thankful to you, for if it never
cured me it would be a God-send to wear for relief of that horrid dead
ache and dragging pain in my groin and back. I shall want some of your
Crayons soon, and will write again in a few weeks. Please tell me how
long the wash ought to stand before it is strained, and whether it would
hurt me to use it _twice_ a day instead of once.

      "Very respectfully,      D. L. B."


"PERFECTLY CURED."

      "ISLIP, Suffolk County, N.Y., February 13, 1884.

"_Dear Sir:_--It is now over two months since I quit wearing the
Cradle-Compressor, and I seat myself to tell you that the Varicocele
seems to be entirely well. The left side is a trifle larger than the
right, but the veins are not wormy as they used to be, and the blood
don't stagnate in them any more. The dragging pain is all gone away,
and the small of my back hasn't pained me for a long time. When I came
to see you in New York, your doctor told me I musn't feel sure that I
was cured until every bit of worminess was gone and the canal was free
of swelled veins. You can tell him that this is so now, and that the
testicles aren't shrunk and wasted the way they used to be.

"Our doctor here, who told me I couldn't be cured unless I had it
operated on, says it's the most remarkable thing he ever saw. Those are
his very words. He didn't seem any too chipper to find out he was wrong
about having to get cut.

"I am a thousand times grateful to you. You have made me a man again,
and I shall not forget it. I am ashamed to think how mean a letter I
wrote you last summer about humbugging and the like, but I apologize
now, and if you find any other people that don't feel sure you can cure
them, send them this letter or get them to write to me.

"I shall remember all you wrote in your last letter about not 'presuming
too much on my improvement,' and to be careful about jumping, straining
and lifting hard, and the like. The Crayons did their work just as well
as the Compress Instrument, and I never can tell you how grateful I am
to you. There's several men I know here that are going to write you
about their cases. One of them, ---- ----, is going down on the train
to-morrow, and will bring this letter with him, he says, for
introduction. Good bye.

      Yours respectfully and gratefully,      DAVID L. B."


REMARKS.

The foregoing three letters tell their story plainly and concisely, and
need little or no explanation. We only desire to append the following
note from our Case Book--"D---- B----; RESIDENCE--Bay Shore, Suffolk
County, Long Island, N.Y.; AGE--54; Sex--Male; CIVIL CONDITION--Widower;
OCCUPATION--Track-Walker on L.I. Railroad (formerly Bayman and Sailor);
DISEASE--Double Varicocele, most pronounced on the left side; glands
much softened and wasted; cord also varicose and very painful.
COMPLICATION--Impaired powers, losses and commencing Impotence.
CAUSE--Indirect and Contributive Abuse in earlier years. DIRECT--Fall
from rigging of a vessel. TREATMENT--Medium Cradle and Inguinal
Compressor and one No. 2 Course Civiale's Soluble Crayons.
RESULT--Perfect cure in about 9 months. REMARKS--As severe and
complicated a case as can be found in any records. The symptoms of
Impotence were undoubtedly due to the pressure of the dilated veins on
the testicles in the scrotum and the seminal duct in the Inguinal Canal.
Patient promises to report, in person, at the end of six months, to
determine whether the cure remains perfect." Mr. B---- has since moved
to Islip, Long Island, where letters of inquiry (containing a stamp for
reply) will reach him.


CONSULTATION.

If you should conclude to place your case in our hands, we shall be
pleased to hear from you, and promise you the most careful and thorough
attention. Our Consulting Staff is large, each physician has his special
department to attend to, and each case is afterwards reviewed by the
whole Board, so as to avoid all possibility of error and give each
sufferer the benefit of the highest skill and research. Our patients,
while numerous, are not such a multitude but that we can and do give
each one of them individually the closest attention. Should it be
convenient for you to visit us in person you will be cordially welcomed.

If you hesitate from ordering, from any cause, we shall be pleased
to correspond with you. We try to feel as if we have a personal
acquaintance with every patient, and treat him as a valued friend; and,
whether you ever order or not, we shall be glad to hear from you and
know your conclusions on this subject. Of course, every letter is
sacredly private. No one reads these but the Manager, and even our old
and trusted medical advisers do not know the names of our patients--only
the numbers and descriptions of cases go into their hands. As a further
assurance we destroy letters, or return them to the writers, whichever
they prefer.

We solicit your influence with your friends, and will be ready to
reciprocate such favors. You will also be often doing such friends a
favor, for which they will always thank you.

We shall be particularly pleased to hear from men advanced in years, who
feel the necessity of counteracting growing weakness incident to their
age, and who know the worse than folly of resorting to pernicious secret
preparations, the effect of which is to give unnatural stimulation for a
brief time, to be followed by a dangerous, perhaps fatal, reaction.


TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.

We make special terms on our instruments and treatment to physicians,
and cordially invite them to correspond with us. We will do all in our
power to serve the profession to their satisfaction. We have the benefit
of the best medical advice and facilities in certain lines not
attainable from any other source on the continent.


GENERAL PRACTITIONERS AND FAMILY PHYSICIANS.

We cannot refrain, before closing this chapter, from saying a word
or two about the incompetency of the large majority of "general
practitioners" and "family physicians," and their evident carelessness,
and in some instances, even disgust, in the diagnosis and treatment of
this class of cases.

The readers of this may be among that class who think the "family
physician" the embodiment of medical wisdom, and that if he has failed
to cure the case or pooh-poohed it away, there is no hope. But no one
M.D., however learned, knows all about the ills of flesh. In this, as in
the legal and other learned professions, a man may practice a score of
years, and still know little or nothing about various peculiar cases,
because they don't come under his notice; he has no opportunity to study
them practically, and little inducement to theorize. And the class of
cases we are now considering, it may surprise the sufferer to know,
are deemed by many "regular" physicians beneath their attention. The
physician's calling is a noble one, and he justly takes a high ground
regarding his duties. We honor the scruples of our medical friends, but
we do not understand nor approve the spirit which leads them to meet
these cases with ridicule or evasive answers.

That they do thus meet this class of cases, and that their course
is censured by the most eminent of the profession, we have abundant
evidence.

One of the best known medical writers of England, F. B. Courtnay, member
of the Royal College of Surgeons, etc., says in one of his works ("True
and False Spermatorrhoea" pp. 20-21):

"Again, some medical men * * * * affect to consider these cases
'objectionable,' and on these grounds seek to avoid them. Others boldly
declare, that as most of such cases are the result of unnatural and
immoral habits, the sufferers are justly punished for their conduct,
and are unworthy of the attention and sympathy of any one.

"Now I conceive this to be a monstrous fallacy; for surely it is
entirely beyond the scope of any medical man's duty to sit in judgment
on the applicants for his professional services. According to my idea of
professional duty, every man is bound to do all in his power to afford
relief to every sufferer who seeks it at his hands, without question as
to the causes and nature of the malady."

Speaking of one of his patients the same writer says:

"He had consulted one of the most eminent members of the medical
profession; and this gentleman evidently listened to his narration of
his case with great impatience and indifference, and upon the conclusion
of his history handed him a prescription, saying: 'There, take that for
six weeks, and if it does not do you any good, I don't know what will.'
The interpretation the patient put on his conduct and the remarks was,
that he need not trouble himself to call again.

"Now, I have the pleasure of personally knowing the professional
gentleman here referred to, and during the last twenty years have been
in the constant habit of meeting him in consultation, and I am sure,
from my knowledge of him, that his behavior resulted from no intentional
unkindness on his part, but solely from the unfortunate feeling of
reluctance to attend to such cases, which, both from my own observations
and from information obtained from patients, I know to be entertained by
too many members of the profession. * * * I am well aware that patients
of this class are often most tedious in the narration of their cases;
that the details they conceive themselves bound to enter upon are most
painful, not to say disgusting, to hear; nevertheless we must, as in
many other instances in the discharge of our duties, submit with
patience, taking the rough and smooth with the same equanimity, and
in the special cases in question, we should endeavor to forget the
patient's vices in his woes."

Another distinguished physician writes:

"I cannot disregard the appeals of unhappy and humiliated people. Men
have come to me who were ashamed to show their organs because of their
diminutiveness, and who practiced masturbation and lived in celibacy
rather than bear the humiliation of exposure of the parts. Nothing can
be more pitiable than such a condition."

If these very moral and dainty practitioners, who, as Dr. Courtnay
says, affect to consider these cases "objectionable" and the sufferers
"unworthy of the attention or sympathy of any one"--if these moralists
could sit at our desk, and day after day, week after week, read the
affecting stories of enforced celibacy, shattered health, broken family
ties, the anguish of jealousy, despair, misanthropy, the consciousness
of physical, mental and moral inferiority begotten by this sad
condition--we think that then these gentlemen would agree with us that
medical science and philanthropy can have no higher object than the
saving of these wrecks.


OUR PATIENTS' LETTERS AND TESTIMONIALS.

Our correspondents are candid--they cannot well afford to be
otherwise--and it is seldom we read one of their letters without feeling
all the interest in the writer that one can for an honest suffering
fellow being. We would not feel this interest did they not evince an
earnest desire to profit by their misfortunes. Our aid is not sought
by those wishing a brute's power for excesses, for we hold out no
inducements to this class, but plainly tell them that they will
inevitably pay the penalty for abuse of nature's laws. Nor are our
patrons among the vicious and imaginative youth, or the class termed
"greenhorns." We confine our advertising almost wholly to the daily
press, thus reaching the most intelligent class of citizens only.

We regret that, for obvious reasons, we cannot present some of the
letters we have received from those who have been treated by our method.
We are pledged to secresy with our correspondents, however, and cannot
use their names publicly; we cannot publish testimonials, although we
have scores of such a nature as to satisfy the most incredulous, yet all
must understand that it would be a breach of confidence on our part to
make these public, and would ruin our practice besides, as we can only
do business of this nature under guarantee of strict privacy. But of the
many hundreds we have successfully treated, a number have voluntarily
given us permission to refer to them in correspondence with interested
parties.

We will cheerfully furnish, on conditions named below, a list of some
of the persons who have taken this mode of treatment, been thoroughly
developed in size and strength of the organs, and relieved of every
trace of seminal disease or weakness, and from gratitude and good hearts
have volunteered to answer any questions addressed to them by interested
persons, who are, of course, expected to hold such correspondence
confidential. Bear in mind that we use these names only by permission,
which was given us unsought by patrons who paid for our services, and
now tender this privilege more through kindness to sufferers than a
desire to benefit us financially. To save these gentlemen annoyance and
useless correspondence, we prefer not to furnish their names except to
those who have had previous correspondence with us and who will
accompany the request with references.


BASHFULNESS AND FALSE MODESTY.

We are sorry to note in some of our patrons a feeling of shame in taking
this treatment. Such feeling we cannot but regard as absurd, and the
outgrowth of false ideas. If their present condition has been brought
on by evil habits, it is well enough to be ashamed of that fact, but it
is certainly altogether creditable to make use of the first opportunity
to restore or attain a perfectly natural condition and check such
disastrous losses, and in many cases it is absolutely necessary for the
welfare and happiness of themselves and others. A well-known medical
writer says:

"This treatment does not interfere with any regular habits or
employment, and may be followed without the knowledge or suspicion of
any person whatever. It is beneficial to the general health and quite
pleasant in its effects, giving the person a rejuvenated, buoyant
feeling, infusing new life and manhood; seemingly dashing young strong
blood through all the sluggish veins and arteries of the form."

To those who really need this treatment its importance cannot be
overestimated. Each sufferer can answer to himself how very different
life would be if free from his infirmity. Would you not be better
capacitated for business, labor or pleasure? Is not your mind on
the rack often--perhaps always? Have you not at this time, and in
consequence of this deficiency, a tendency to misanthrophy, a bitter
feeling that you are the victim of an unkind Providence, or else bowed
by humiliation due to your own ignorance or vices? Does not your very
incapacity keep your mind filled with lewd thoughts, which in a state of
perfect manhood would not exist?

From the confession of hundreds we know how each of you will answer most
or all of these questions.

Is not the means, then, which will raise you above these deplorable
conditions, a blessing inestimable? Is it not an agent of moral as well
as physical regeneration? When this means of deliverance is offered,
will you hesitate in availing yourself of its benefits and making it
known to others who are sufferers like yourself? Let an honest heart
and candid judgment answer for you.


THE FALLACY OF CHEAP REMEDIES.

There are many men who are affected more or less seriously with Diseases
of the Sexual Organs who are constantly on the look-out for so-called
cheap remedies, and in the course of a few years manage to spend upon
these cheap and trashy medicines and appliances twice or three times as
much money as would have been necessary to thoroughly cure them. And
what have they got to show for it? Nothing--absolutely nothing, aye,
even worse than nothing, _i.e._, positive injury to the organs, for,
in nine cases out of ten, these cheap, clap-trap potions, by over
stimulating, imitating and often inflaming the organs, do them actual
harm, hasten and aggravate the disease and leave the patient in a much
worse condition than if he had taken no treatment at all.

How often have we had cases referred to us for diagnosis and treatment,
where irreparable injury had been done by wrong treatment. Some were in
such a state that no treatment, however excellent, could possibly help
them; in others we have had to labor for months to eliminate these
poisonous medicines from the system and get the Sexual Organs into
proper condition to admit of a restorative treatment; and in still
others the effect of our usually quick and thorough-going remedies were
delayed and interfered with by the ignorance or botchwork of some quack
or bungler, or the well-meant but stupid doctoring of some "family
physician" who thinks himself competent to treat these diseases.

No more delicate, complicated or easily injured or disarranged piece of
mechanism than the Sexual Organs exists. In health, they must be treated
with care and reason--in disease, with the utmost circumspection. This
branch of medicine, least of all, should be the parade ground of
ignorance, carelessness or false economy. A man's very health, life,
happiness and vigor, his power to procreate his species, to perpetuate
his name, his ability to make his wife happy and his children strong and
vigorous, all depend upon the treatment he selects. What is worth doing
at all is worth doing well, and he who jeopardizes health and happiness,
present and future, on the mistaken basis of false economy, is far from
wise.

Everything has a value. If a man offers to sell to another a gold watch
worth $150 for $5, you would at once set him down as an impostor, and
the watch as injured or worthless or fraudulent. Yet there are thousands
of men who try to find for a few dollars a remedy for a most serious and
complicated disease. In medicine, as elsewhere, Common Sense plays an
important part. Such remedies cannot possibly do what is claimed for
them. Reputable, honest men, educated and skilled physicians who have
spent thousands of dollars in obtaining a proper medical education,
cannot afford to waste their time for such slight remuneration. Hence,
unscrupulous scoundrels, who have no reputations either to make or lose,
who make most glaring promises in their printed matter, who are willing
to guarantee anything to anybody, infest this field. They know how great
is man's cupidity, and trade upon it willingly, caring nothing for the
consequences.


OUR REMEDIES ARE RELIABLE AND REASONABLE.

We not speak thus disparagingly of cheap remedies because ours are dear,
for no patient who has gone the round of cheap remedies, and has at last
profited by Civiale's method, but will tell you that our treatment is
cheap at any price.

We charge what we consider a fair and reasonable profit on our remedies.
Our entire institution is conducted on the very highest and most ethical
medical basis. The Physicians comprising our Consulting Staff are men
of the best standing, of fine education, and having special experience
in this branch of medical science; our remedies are made up under the
direct personal supervision of one of the most expert chemists in this
country, and precisely after Civiale's formulæ; our drugs are purchased
from such firms as McKesson & Robbins, Schieffelin, etc., and are of the
purest and best, and our aim at all times is to give the patient
consulting us the full value of his money.

For such skill and services we charge fairly and reasonably, and we have
yet to find a patient who is dissatisfied. Our cases get well, provided
our advice is followed and a cure is possible. If it is not, we frankly
and candidly tell the truth. We cannot afford to make false statements
or false promises, to hold out hopes we cannot justify, to ruin our
established and well-known reputation for honesty, fair dealing and
medical skill in order to make a few dollars. We find that one man cured
is the very best advertisement we can have, and that one such case makes
us one warm friend and advocate, and brings us many patients, where one
man deceived and defrauded would make us one bitter enemy and injure us
in the eyes of many. Thus, every other consideration of honor and
honesty aside, it pays us better to deal fairly with our patrons.

This treatment has been thoroughly tried in the most desperate and
adverse cases, and has stood the test of time and repeated trials, has
stood these tests as no other remedy or remedies ever have or ever will,
and in them men of all ages and all conditions may find strength, health
and vigor.

A SPECIAL AND IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.

STRICT MORALITY vs. FALSE MODESTY.


In preparing both the first and later editions of this little work (that
has brought happiness to so many by opening the way to knowledge of a
proper means of cure and methods of regaining health and vigor), +the
utmost care and circumspection have been exercised in an endeavor to
exclude from its pages anything that could be construed by the most
fastidious as immodest, obscene, or in any way offensive to decency,
morality or good breeding+. Indeed, although purely and essentially
+a medical work, and intended solely for such persons whose duty it is
to be acquainted with the facts given+, in order to understand their
complaint, to place themselves under proper treatment, and to avoid
the dangers of quackery, we have in many instances wholly excluded
or materially modified the wording of passages in order to comply
with our original ideas of the strictest purity of thought and speech
commensurate with a truthful and honest statement of facts.

We wish it distinctly understood that +this treatise is intended solely
for persons suffering from Genito-Urinary Diseases+, and that it is
+never mailed to any person who has not voluntarily requested us to send
it+, and then +not to boys+ or to members of the +opposite sex+. (Our
application books show a large number of such refusals.)

We look upon our special mission in the field of medicine as +distinct+,
+laudable+ and +holy+. There are those who look down upon this special
branch of medicine, and some ignoramuses who assert that such diseases
only exist in the imaginations of such patients as a result of reading
the pamphlets of quacks who paint frightful pictures of insanity,
idiocy, etc. To such men as these we have only this to say: Consult the
works of Hammond, Black, Acton, Wilson, Lallemand, Civialè, Courtenay,
Lee etc., etc., the authors of which have world-wide reputations, not
only as physicians, but as truthful, honest and moral men. They will
then see how really grave are such affections and how needful of aid.

God knows that the misery, despondency and actual organic disease,
as a result of early vices, are prevalent enough even to-day to make a
lover of his fellow men sincerely pity and desire to help them. And we
claim (and every honest man cannot but admit) that it is only by the
+widespread dissemination of a knowledge of certain facts+ to young and
old, especially the former, that such vice and its consequences can be
met and overcome. We are daily spreading such knowledge throughout the
length and breadth of this land, not only warning and advising the young
and cautioning the older, but also pointing out to all such as need it a
perfect and easy means of cure and restoration to health and vigor.

Our mission is as real, noble and important as that of preaching the
Gospel, and aside from its bearing on the enlightenment of those who
would otherwise go astray, and offering the means of relief to those who
have already sinned against Nature, it is of a broader and even more
sweeping importance. As every whole must needs be the sum total of its
integrals, so +each nation+ and +people must+--in mental, moral and
physical traits--+be that which its individual members make it+.
Hence, if perfect general health, full procreative ability and healthy
offspring mark the majority of the individuals, so naturally must the
health, vigor, populousness and power of the nation be accordingly.
+As secret vice diminishes, public virtue and morality become greater.+
Diseases of the Prostate Gland, Urinary Organs and Sexual Apparatus are
as +real, as embarassing+ and +as needful of cure+ as those of the
lungs, heart, stomach, or any other organ--indeed, more important, for
the latter only affect the life or health of the individual immediately
concerned, while the former concern not only the person affected, but
his offspring also.

There is no reason why false modesty or pseudo-delicacy should reign
supreme here. If the Almighty had intended these matters to be viewed
and treated in the light which some fanatics and extremists seem to
desire, we would certainly have been created without the power of
procreation entirely. As it is, such organs and such diseases +do
exist+, are of the greatest (individual and national) importance, and
provided a +full knowledge of the causes and consequences of vice and
abuse as related to these parts can be brought vividly and strongly
before the mind of every man, young or old, in a chaste, decent and
strictly professional manner+, the result can only be a good one, and
those who deny it are engaged in moral hair-splitting.

We felt that the foregoing remarks were both +apropos+ and necessary
with a view to contradicting some statements recently made regarding
the uselessness and demoralizing effects of everything concerning this
branch of medical practice, and as due ourselves in distinctly recording
our belief and practice in the matter; more especially to refute the
false accusation that special medical treatises were being scattered
broadcast over the land and made to invade the privacy of homes, and
coming into the hands of young boys and females.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
