PREFACE


For this rhymed version of the Fables I have to thank my early friend
and master W.J. LINTON, who kindly placed the MS. at my disposal. I
have added a touch here and there, but the credit of this part of the
book still belongs to him.

ÆSOP'S FABLES

[Illustration]




THE FOX & THE GRAPES


This Fox has a longing for grapes,
He jumps, but the bunch still escapes.
  So he goes away sour;
  And, 'tis said, to this hour
Declares that he's no taste for grapes.

THE GRAPES OF DISAPPOINTMENT ARE ALWAYS SOUR




THE COCK & THE PEARL

[Illustration]


A rooster, while scratching for grain,
Found a Pearl. He just paused to explain
  That a jewel's no good
  To a fowl wanting food,
And then kicked it aside with disdain.

IF HE ASK BREAD WILL YE GIVE HIM A STONE?




THE WOLF AND THE LAMB


A wolf, wanting lamb for his dinner,
Growled out--"Lamb you wronged me, you sinner."
  Bleated Lamb--"Nay, not true!"
  Answered Wolf--"Then 'twas Ewe--
Ewe or lamb, you will serve for my dinner."

FRAUD AND VIOLENCE HAVE NO SCRUPLES




THE WIND & THE SUN

[Illustration]


The Wind and the Sun had a bet,
The wayfarers' cloak which should get:
  Blew the Wind--the cloak clung:
  Shone the Sun--the cloak flung
Showed the Sun had the best of it yet.

TRUE STRENGTH IS NOT BLUSTER




KING LOG & KING STORK

[Illustration]


The Frogs prayed to Jove for a king:
"Not a log, but a livelier thing."
  Jove sent them a Stork,
  Who did royal work,
For he gobbled them up, did their king.

DON'T HAVE KINGS




THE FRIGHTENED LION

[Illustration]


A Bull Frog, according to rule,
Sat a-croak in his usual pool:
  And he laughed in his heart
  As a Lion did start
In a fright from the brink like a fool.

IMAGINARY FEARS ARE THE WORST




THE MOUSE & THE LION

[Illustration]


A poor thing the Mouse was, and yet,
When the Lion got caught in a net,
  All his strength was no use
  'Twas the poor little Mouse
Who nibbled him out of the net.

SMALL CAUSES MAY PRODUCE GREAT RESULTS




THE MARRIED MOUSE


So the Mouse had Miss Lion for bride;
Very great was his joy and his pride:
  But it chanced that she put
  On her husband her foot,
And the weight was too much, so he died.

ONE MAY BE TOO AMBITIOUS




HERCULES & THE WAGGONER

[Illustration]


When the God saw the Waggoner kneel,
Crying, "Hercules! Lift me my wheel
  From the mud, where 'tis stuck!"
  He laughed--"No such luck;
Set your shoulder yourself to the wheel."

THE GODS HELP THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES




THE LAZY HOUSEMAIDS

[Illustration]


Two Maids killed the Rooster whose warning
Awoke them too soon every morning:
  But small were their gains,
  For their Mistress took pains
To rouse them herself without warning.

LAZINESS IS ITS OWN PUNISHMENT




THE SNAKE & THE FILE

[Illustration]


A Snake, in a fix, tried a File
For a dinner. "'Tis not worth your while,"
  Said the steel, "don't mistake;
  I'm accustomed to _take_,
To _give's_ not the way of a File."

WE MAY MEET OUR MATCH




THE FOX & THE CROW


Said sly Fox to the Crow with the cheese,
"Let me hear your sweet voice, now do please!"
  And this Crow, being weak,
  Cawed the bit from her beak--
"Music charms," said the Fox, "and here's cheese!"

BEWARE OF FLATTERERS




THE DOG IN THE MANGER

[Illustration]


A Cow sought a mouthful of hay;
But a Dog in the manger there lay,
  And he snapped out "how now?"
  When most mildly, the Cow
Adventured a morsel to pray.

DON'T BE SELFISH




THE FROG & THE BULL


Said the Frog, quite puffed up to the eyes,
"Was this Bull about me as to size?"
  "Rather bigger, frog-brother."
  "Puff, puff," said the other,
"A Frog is a Bull if he tries!"

BRAG IS NOT ALWAYS BELIEF




THE FOX & THE CRANE

[Illustration]


You have heard how Sir Fox treated Crane:
With soup in a plate. When again
  They dined, a long bottle
  Just suited Crane's throttle;
And Sir Fox licked the outside in vain.

THERE ARE GAMES THAT TWO CAN PLAY AT




HORSE AND MAN

[Illustration]


When the Horse first took Man on his back,
To help him the Stag to attack;
  How little his dread,
  As the enemy fled,
Man would make him his slave & his hack.

ADVANTAGES MAY BE DEARLY BOUGHT




THE ASS & THE ENEMY


"Get up! let us flee from the Foe,"
Said the Man: but the Ass said, "Why so?"
  "Will they double my load,
  Or my blows? Then, by goad,
And by stirrup, I've no cause to go."

YOUR REASONS ARE NOT MINE




THE FOX & THE MOSQUITOES

[Illustration]


Being plagued with Mosquitoes one day,
Said old Fox, "pray don't send them away,
  For a hungrier swarm
  Would work me more harm;
I had rather the full ones should stay."

THERE WERE POLITICIANS IN ÆSOP'S TIME




THE FOX & THE LION


The first time the Fox had a sight
Of the Lion, he 'most died of fright;
  When he next met his eye,
  Fox felt just a bit shy;
But the next--quite at ease, & polite.

FAMILIARITY DESTROYS FEAR




THE MISER & HIS GOLD

[Illustration]


He buried his Gold in a hole.
One saw, and the treasure he stole.
  Said another, "What matter?
  Don't raise such a clatter,
You can still go & sit by the hole."

USE ALONE GIVES VALUE




THE GOLDEN EGGS


A golden Egg, one every day,
That simpleton's Goose used to lay;
  So he killed the poor thing,
  Swifter fortune to bring,
And dined off his fortune that day.

GREED OVEREACHES ITSELF

[Transcriber's Note: 'OVEREACHES' should be 'OVERREACHES']




THE MAN THAT PLEASED NONE

[Illustration]


Through the town this good Man & his Son
Strove to ride as to please everyone:
  Self, Son, or both tried,
  Then the Ass had a ride;
While the world, at their efforts, poked fun.

YOU CANNOT HOPE TO PLEASE ALL--DON'T TRY




THE OAK & THE REEDS

[Illustration]


Giant Oak, in his strength & his scorn
Of the winds, by the roots was uptorn:
  But slim Reeds at his side,
  The fierce gale did outride,
Since, by bending the burden was borne.

BEND, NOT BREAK




THE FIR & THE BRAMBLE


The Fir-tree looked down on the Bramble.
"Poor thing, only able to scramble
  About on the ground."
  Just then an axe' sound
Made the Fir wish himself but a Bramble.

PRIDE OF PLACE HAS ITS DISADVANTAGES




THE TREES & THE WOODMAN

[Illustration]


The Trees ask of Man what he lacks;
"One bit, just to handle my axe?"
  All he asks--well and good:
  But he cuts down the wood,
So well does he handle his axe!

"GIVE ME AN INCH & I'LL TAKE AN ELL"




THE HART & THE VINE

[Illustration]


A Hart by the hunters pursued,
Safely hid in a Vine, till he chewed
  The sweet tender green,
  And, through shaking leaves seen,
He was slain by his ingratitude.

SPARE YOUR BENEFACTORS




THE MAN & THE SNAKE

[Illustration]


In pity he brought the poor Snake
To be warmed at his fire. A mistake!
  For the ungrateful thing
  Wife & children would sting.
I have known some as bad as the Snake.

BEWARE HOW YOU ENTERTAIN TRAITORS




THE FOX & THE MASK

[Illustration]


A Fox with his foot on a Mask,
Thus took the fair semblance to task;
  "You're a real handsome face;
  But what part of your case
Are your brains in, good Sir! let me ask?"

MASKS ARE THE FACES OF SHAMS




THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN

[Illustration]


"What pranks I shall play!" thought the Ass,
"In this skin for a Lion to pass;"
  But he left one ear out,
  And a hiding, no doubt,
"Lion" had--on the skin of an Ass!

IMPOSTERS GENERALLY FORGET SOMETHING




THE LION & THE STATVE

[Illustration]


On a Statue--king Lion dethroned,
Showing conqueror Man,--Lion frowned.
  "If a Lion, you know,
  Had been sculptor, he'd show
Lion rampant, and Man on the ground."

THE STORY DEPENDS ON THE TELLER




THE BOASTER

[Illustration]


In the house, in the market, the streets,
Everywhere he was boasting his feats;
  Till one said, with a sneer,
  "Let us see it done here!
What's so oft done with ease, one repeats."

DEEDS NOT WORDS




THE VAIN JACKDAW

[Illustration]


"Fine feathers," Jack thought, "make fine fowls;
I'll be envied of bats & of owls:"
  But the peacocks' proud eyes
  Saw through his disguise,
And Jack fled the assembly of fowls.

BORROWED PLUMES ARE SOON DISCOVERED




THE PEACOCK'S COMPLAINT

[Illustration]


The Peacock considered it wrong
That he had not the nightingale's song;
  So to Juno he went,
  She replied, "Be content
With thy having, & hold thy fool's tongue!"

DO NOT QUARREL WITH NATURE




THE TWO JARS

[Illustration]


"Never fear!" said The Brass to the Clay
Of two Jars that the flood bore away:
  "Keep you close to my side!"
  But the porcelain replied,
"I'll be smashed if beside you I stay."

OUR FRIEND OUR ENEMY




THE TWO CRABS


"So awkward, so shambling a gait!"
Mrs Crab did her daughter berate,
  Who rejoined, "It is true
  I am backward; but you
Needed lessons in walking quite late."

LOOK AT HOME




BROTHER & SISTER

[Illustration]


Twin children: the Girl, she was plain;
The Brother was handsome & vain;
  "Let him brag of his looks,"
  Father said; "mind your books!
The best beauty is bred in the brain."

HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES




THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL

[Illustration]


Said Fox, minus tail in a trap,
"My friends! here's a lucky mishap:
  Give your tails a short lease!"
  But the foxes weren't geese,
And none followed the fashion of trap.

YET SOME FASHIONS HAVE NO BETTER REASON




THE DOG & THE SHADOW

[Illustration]


His image the Dog did not know,
Or his bone's, in the pond's painted show:
  "T'other dog," so he thought
  "Has got more than he ought,"
So he snapped, & his dinner saw go!

GREED IS SOMETIMES CAUGHT BY ITS OWN BAIT




THE CROW & THE PITCHER

[Illustration]


How the cunning old Crow got his drink
When 'twas low in the pitcher, just think!
  Don't say that he spilled it!
  With pebbles he filled it,
Till the water rose up to the brink.

USE YOUR WITS




THE EAGLE AND THE CROW

The Eagle flew off with a lamb;
Then the Crow thought to lift an old ram,
  In his eaglish conceit,
  The wool tangled his feet,
And the shepherd laid hold of the sham.

BEWARE OF OVERRATING YOUR OWN POWERS




THE BLIND DOE

[Illustration]


A poor half-blind Doe her one eye
Kept shoreward, all danger to spy,
  As she fed by the sea,
  Poor innocent! she
Was shot from a boat passing by.

WATCH ON ALL SIDES




THE GEESE & THE CRANES

[Illustration]


The Geese joined the Cranes in some wheat;
All was well, till, disturbed at their treat,
  Light-winged, the Cranes fled,
  But the slow Geese, well fed,
Couldn't rise, and were caught in retreat.

BEWARE OF ENTERPRIZES WHERE THE RISKS ARE NOT EQUAL




THE TRUMPETER TAKEN PRISONER

[Illustration]


A Trumpeter, prisoner made,
Hoped his life would be spared when he said
  He'd no part in the fight,
  But they answered him--"Right,
But what of the music you made?"

SONGS MAY SERVE A CAUSE AS WELL AS SWORDS




HOT AND COLD

[Illustration]


When to warm his cold fingers man blew,
And again, but to cool the hot stew;
  Simple Satyr, unused
  To man's ways, felt confused,
When the same mouth blew hot & cold too!

ÆSOP AIMED AT DOUBLE DEALING




NEITHER BEAST NOR BIRD

[Illustration]


A Beast he would be, or a bird,
As might suit, thought the Bat: but he erred.
  When the battle was done,
  He found that no one
Would take him for friend at his word.

BETWEEN TWO STOOLS YOU MAY COME TO THE GROUND




THE STAG IN THE OX STALL

[Illustration]


Safe enough lay the poor hunted Deer
In the ox-stall, with nothing to fear
  From the careless-eyed men:
  Till the Master came; then
There was no hiding-place for the Deer.

AN EYE IS KEEN IN ITS OWN INTEREST




THE DEER & THE LION


From the hounds the swift Deer sped away,
To his cave, where in past times he lay
  Well concealed; unaware
  Of a Lion couched there,
For a spring that soon made him his prey.

FATE CAN MEET AS WELL AS FOLLOW




THE LION IN LOVE

[Illustration]


Though the Lion in love let them draw
All his teeth, and pare down every claw,
  He'd no bride for his pains,
  For they beat out his brains
Ere he set on his maiden a paw.

OUR VERY MEANS MAY DEFEAT OUR ENDS




THE CAT AND VENUS

[Illustration]


"Might his Cat be a woman," he said:
Venus changed her: the couple were wed:
  But a mouse in her sight
  Metamorphosed her quite,
And for bride, a cat found he instead.

NATURE WILL OUT




MICE IN COUNCIL


Against Cat sat a Council of Mice.
Every Mouse came out prompt with advice;
  And a bell on Cat's throat
  Would have met a round vote,
Had the bell-hanger not been so nice.

THE BEST POLICY OFTEN TURNS ON AN IF




THE HEN AND THE FOX

[Illustration]


The Hen roosted high on her perch;
Hungry Fox down below, on the search,
  Coaxed her hard to descend
  She replied, "Most dear friend!
I feel more secure on my perch."

BEWARE OF INTERESTED FRIENDSHIPS




THE CAT AND THE FOX


The Fox said "I can play, when it fits,
Many wiles that with man make me quits."
  "But my trick's up a tree!"
  Said the Cat, safe to see
Clever Fox hunted out of his wits.

TRUST TO SKILL RATHER THAN WIT




THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE

[Illustration]


'Twas a race between Tortoise and Hare,
Puss was sure she'd so much time to spare,
  That she lay down to sleep,
  And let old Thick-shell creep
To the winning post first!--You may stare.

PERSISTENCE BEATS IMPULSE




THE HARES AND THE FROGS


Timid Hares, from the trumpeting wind,
Fled as swift as the fear in their mind;
  Till in fright from their fear,
  From the green sedges near,
Leaping Frogs left their terror behind.

OUR OWN ARE NOT THE ONLY TROUBLES




PORCUPINE, SNAKE, & COMPANY

[Illustration]


Going shares with the Snakes, Porcupine
Said--"the best of the bargain is mine:"
  Nor would he back down,
  When the snake would disown
The agreement his quills made them sign.

HASTY PARTNERSHIPS MAY BE REPENTED OF




THE BEAR & THE BEES


"Their honey I'll have when I please;
Who cares for such small things as Bees?"
  Said the Bear; but the stings
  Of these very small things
Left him not very much at his ease.

THE WEAKEST UNITED MAY BE STRONG TO AVENGE




THE BUNDLE OF STICKS

[Illustration]


To his sons, who fell out, father spake:
"This Bundle of Sticks you can't break;
  Take them singly, with ease,
  You may break as you please,
So, dissension your strength will unmake."

STRENGTH IS IN UNITY




THE FARMER'S TREASURE

[Illustration]


"Dig deeply, my Sons! through this field!
There's a Treasure"--he died: unrevealed
  The spot where 'twas laid,
  They dug as he bade;
And the Treasure was found in the yield.

PRODUCTIVE LABOUR IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF WEALTH




THE COCK, THE ASS & THE LION

[Illustration]


The Ass gave a horrible bray,
Cock crowed; Lion scampered away;
  Ass judged he was scared
  By the bray, and so dared
To pursue; Lion ate him they say.

DON'T TAKE ALL THE CREDIT TO YOURSELF




THE ASS AND THE LAP DOG


"How Master that little Dog pets!"
Thinks the Ass; & with jealousy frets,
  So he climbs Master's knees,
  Hoping dog-like to please,
And a drubbing is all that he gets.

ASSES MUST NOT EXPECT TO BE FONDLED




FORTVNE AND THE BOY

[Illustration]


A Boy heedless slept by the well
By Dame Fortune awaked, truth to tell,
  Said she, "Hadst been drowned,
  'Twould have surely been found
This by Fortune, not Folly befel."

FORTUNE IS NOT ANSWERABLE FOR OUR WANT OF FORESIGHT




THE UNGRATEFUL WOLF

[Illustration]


To the Wolf, from whose throat Dr Crane
Drew the bone, his long bill made it plain
  He expected his fee:
  Snarled Wolf--"Fiddle de dee,
Be thankful your head's out again."

SOME CHARACTERS HAVE NO SENSE OF OBLIGATION




THE FISHERMAN & THE FISH


Prayed the Fish, as the Fisherman took
Him, a poor little mite, from his hook,
  "Let me go! I'm so small."
  He replied, "Not at all!
You're the biggest, perhaps in the brook."

A LITTLE CERTAINTY IS BETTER THAN A GREAT CHANCE




THE HERDSMAN'S VOWS

[Illustration]


A Kid vowed to Jove, so might he
Find his herd, & his herd did he see
  Soon, of lions the prey:
  Then 'twas--"Get me away,
And a goat of the best take for fee."

HOW OFTEN WOULD WE MEND OUR WISHES!




THE HORSE AND THE ASS


Overladen the Ass was. The Horse
Wouldn't help; but had time for remorse
  When the Ass lay dead there;
  For he then had to bear
Both the load of the Ass & his corse.

GRUDGE NOT HELP!




THE ASS & THE SICK LION

[Illustration]


Crafty Lion,--perhaps with the gout,
Kept his cave; where, to solve any doubt,
  Many visitors go:
  But the Ass, he said "No!
They go in, but I've seen none come out."

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
