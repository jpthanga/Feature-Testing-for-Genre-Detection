THE HISTORY OF TOM THUMB _AND OTHER STORIES_

[Illustration]

_Profusely Illustrated_



THE HISTORY OF TOM THUMB

In the days of King Arthur, Merlin, the famous enchanter, was out on a
journey, and stopped one day at the cottage of an honest ploughman to
ask for refreshment. The ploughman's wife brought him some milk in a
wooden bowl, and some brown bread on a wooden platter.

Merlin could not help observing that, although everything within the
cottage was particularly neat and in good order, the ploughman and
his wife had the most sorrowful air, so he questioned them about the
cause of their distress, and learned that they were miserable because
they had no children. The poor woman declared that she would be the
happiest creature in the world if she had but a son, although he were
no bigger than his father's thumb. Merlin was very much amused at the
thought of a boy no bigger than a man's thumb; and as soon as he
returned home he sent for the Queen of the Fairies and related to her
the desire of the ploughman and his wife to have a son the size of his
father's thumb.

[Illustration]

The Queen of the Fairies promised that their wish should be granted.
And so it happened one day that the ploughman's wife had a son
exactly of the size of his father's thumb. While the mother was
sitting up in bed, admiring the child, the Queen of the Fairies
appeared, and kissed the infant, giving it the name of Tom Thumb, and
summoned several fairies to clothe her little favorite.

Tom never grew any bigger; but, as he grew older, he became very
cunning and sly, which his mother did not sufficiently correct him
for; so that, when he was old enough to play with the boys for
cherry-stones, and had lost all his own, he used to creep into the
other boys' bags, fill his pockets, and come out again to play. But
one day, as he was getting out of a bag of cherry-stones, the boy to
whom it belonged chanced to see him.

[Illustration]

"Ah, ah! my little Tom Thumb," said the boy, "have I caught you at
your bad tricks at last? Now I will pay you off well for thieving."

Then drawing the string tight round his neck, and shaking the bag
heartily, the cherry stones bruised Tom's limbs and body sadly, which
made him beg to be let out, and promise never to be guilty of such
doings any more.

Shortly afterwards Tom's mother was making a batter pudding, and, that
he might see how she mixed it, he climbed up to the edge of the bowl,
but his foot happening to slip he fell over head and ears into the
batter, and his mother not observing him, stirred him into the pudding
and popped it all into the pot to boil. The hot water made Tom kick
and struggle; and his mother, seeing the pudding jump up and down,
thought it was bewitched. A tinker was going by just at the time, so
she gave him the pudding, and he put it into his budget and walked
away. As soon as Tom could get the batter out of his mouth he began to
cry aloud; this so frightened the poor tinker that he flung the
pudding over the hedge. The pudding being broken by the fall Tom was
released, and walked home to his mother, who gave him a kiss and put
him to bed.

Tom Thumb's mother once took him with her when she went to milk the
cow; it being a very windy day, she tied him with a needleful of
thread to a thistle. The cow, liking his oak-leaf hat, took him and
the thistle up at one mouthful. While the cow was chewing the thistle,
Tom, terrified at her great teeth, cried out, "Mother! mother!"

[Illustration]

"Where are you, Tommy, my dear Tommy?" said the mother.

"Here, mother; here in the red cow's mouth."

The mother began to cry and wring her hands; but the cow, surprised at
such odd noises in her throat, opened her mouth and let him drop out.
His mother clapped him into her apron and ran home with him.

[Illustration]

Tom's father made him a whip of barley-straw to drive the cattle with,
and one day in the field Tom slipped into a deep furrow. A raven
flying over picked him up with a grain of corn, and flew with him to
the top of the giant's castle by the seaside, where he left him. Old
Grumbo, the giant, came out soon afterwards, to walk upon his terrace,
and Tom, frightened out of his wits, managed to creep up his sleeve.
Tom's motions made the giant uncomfortable, and with a jerk of his
arm, he threw him into the sea. A great fish then swallowed him. The
fish was soon after caught, and sent as a present to King Arthur. When
it was cut open, everybody was delighted with little Tom Thumb, who
was found inside. He became the favorite of the whole court, and by
his merry pranks often amused the King and Queen.

[Illustration]

The King, when he rode on horseback, frequently took Tom in his hand;
and if a shower of rain came on, the tiny dwarf used to creep into the
King's waistcoat pocket and sleep till the rain was over. The King now
questioned him concerning his parents; and when Tom informed his
majesty they were very poor people, the King led him into his
treasury, and told him he should pay them a visit and take with him
as much money as he could carry.

[Illustration]

Tom soon got rested at his mother's house, but could not travel
because it had rained; his mother therefore took him in her hand and
carried him back to King Arthur's court. There Tom entertained the
King and Queen and nobility at tilts and tournaments, at which he
exerted himself so much that he brought on a fit of sickness. At this
juncture the Queen of the Fairies came in a chariot drawn by flying
mice, and placing Tom by her side she drove through the air till they
arrived at her palace. After restoring him to health, the Queen
commanded a fair wind, and, placing Tom before it, blew him straight
back to the court of King Arthur. But just as Tom should have alighted
in the courtyard, the cook happened to pass with the King's great
bowl of his favorite dish, furmenty, and poor Tom fell plump into the
middle of it, and splashed the hot furmenty into the cook's eyes. Down
went the bowl. "Oh, dear," cried Tom. "Murder! murder!" bellowed the
cook; and away ran the King's nice furmenty into the kennel. The cook
was a cross fellow and swore to the King that Tom had done it out of
some evil design; so he was tried for high treason and sentenced to be
beheaded. When the judge delivered this dreadful sentence it happened
that a miller was standing by with his mouth wide open, so Tom took a
good spring and jumped down his throat, unperceived by all, even by
the miller himself. As Tom could not be found the court broke up, and
away went the miller to his mill. But Tom did not leave him long at
rest, he began to roll and tumble about, so that the miller thought
himself bewitched, and sent for a doctor. When the doctor came, Tom
began to dance and sing. The doctor was as much frightened as the
miller, and sent in great haste for five more doctors.

[Illustration]

While all these were talking the miller began to yawn, and Tom, taking
the opportunity, made another bold jump and alighted on his feet in
the middle of the table. The miller, provoked to be thus tormented by
such a little creature, caught hold of Tom and threw him out of the
window into the river. A large salmon swimming by snapped him up in a
moment.

The salmon was soon caught and sold in the market to the steward of a
great lord. The grandee, thinking it an uncommonly fine fish, made a
present of it to the King, who ordered it to be dressed immediately.
When the cook cut open the salmon he found poor Tom inside, and ran
with him directly to the King; but the King being busy, desired that
he might be brought another day.

[Illustration]

The cook was resolved to keep him safely this time, so clapped him
into a mouse-trap. There he was shut up for a whole week, when the
King sent for him, forgave him for throwing down the furmenty, and
ordered him new clothes, gave him a spirited mouse for a hunter, and
knighted him.

Thus dressed and mounted, he rode a hunting with the King and
nobility.

[Illustration]

As they were riding by a farmhouse one day, a cat jumped from behind
the door, seized the mouse and little Tom, ran off with them both,
and was just going to devour the mouse when Tom boldly drew his sword
and attacked the cat with great spirit. The King and his nobles,
seeing Tom in danger, went to his assistance, and one of the lords
bravely saved him just in time, but poor Tom was sadly scratched by
the claws of the cat.

[Illustration: LICE.]

The Queen of the Fairies came and took him again to Fairyland, where
she kept him some years; after which, dressing him in bright green,
she sent him flying once more through the air to the earth. King
Thunstone now reigned in the place of King Arthur. The people flocked
far and near to look at Tom Thumb, and the King, before whom he was
carried, asked him who he was and where he lived. Tom answered:

  "My name is Tom Thumb,
  From the fairies I come;
  When King Arthur shone,
  This court was my home.
  In me he delighted,
  By him I was knighted.
  Did you ever hear of
  Sir Thomas Thumb?"

The King was so charmed with this address that he ordered a little
chair to be made, and also a palace of gold a span high, with a door
an inch wide, for little Tom to live in. He also gave him a coach,
drawn by six small mice. This made the Queen angry, because she had
not a new coach too; therefore, resolving to ruin Tom, she complained
to the King that he had behaved very insolently to her. The King sent
for him in a rage. Tom, to escape his fury, crept into a large,
empty snail-shell, and there lay for some time, when, peeping out of
the shell, he saw a fine butterfly on the ground. He ventured forth
and got astride the butterfly, which took wing, and mounted into the
air with little Tom on his back. Away he flew straight to the King's
court.

[Illustration: THE WOOD-CUTTER'S DAUGHTER.]

The King, Queen, and nobles all strove to catch the butterfly. At
length poor Tom slipped from his seat, and fell into a sweet dish
called white-pot, where he was found, almost drowned. The Queen vowed
he should be punished, and he was secured once more in a mouse-trap,
when the cat, seeing something stir, and supposing it to be a mouse,
patted the trap about till she broke it and set Tom at liberty.

[Illustration]

Soon afterwards a spider, taking poor Tom for a big fly, made a
spring at him. Tom drew his sword and fought valiantly, but the
spider's poisonous breath overcame him.

King Thunstone and his whole court went into mourning for little Tom
Thumb. They buried him under a rose-bush, and raised a nice, white
marble monument over his grave.

[Illustration]



THE LION AND THE FOX

There was once a fox who had never seen a lion; and so, when he saw a
lion for the first time, this fox was so scared that he did not know
what to do.

The lion did him no harm: and the fox crept off out of the way, and
ran to his hole, and there hid. He stayed in his hole a long while,
until he found he must go in search of food, and then he crept out.

[Illustration]

Ella and May are the girls you see on this page. Ella is older than
May, and can read, but May cannot.

But Ella is kind, and will read to May a long time, if May will do as
she is bid, and sit still on her lap.

And Ella will show May how to read herself.

[Illustration]

In a country called Holland, storks are very kindly treated, for so
many frogs live in the marshes there, that if the storks did not eat
them, the people would hardly know what to do. The storks are very
clever at catching the poor froggies; they snatch them up in their
long bills, and go flying off, with their great wings spread and their
long legs stretched out behind them, carrying off two or three at
once.




CATCHING BLACKBIRDS.


Two little boys were running through the meadows as hard as they could
go. "What are you doing there?" said a man who was passing along.

[Illustration]

"Catching blackbirds?" said Willie. "Have you caught any?" said the
man.

"No, not yet," said Willie. "But grandpa is going to give me five
dollars when I catch one. He wants one."

Willie's grandpa did happen to say to him that morning, "You catch me
a blackbird, and I will give you five dollars." He said it just out of
fun. He did not think that Willie would ever try to do it.

[Illustration]



THE DOG.

Do you see the dog and the hen? The dog bit the hen, and she was mad.
My dog bit a fox on the hip. One day the fox bit the dog on the lip
and ran off. Tom and I had a gun, and we set off to get the fox; but
the sun was so hot we did not go far, but sat on the hay, and had fun.

A LETTER TO FRANK.


[Illustration]

DEAR FRANK,--One day a rabbit came out of the woods to see if he could
find any clover. Some boys saw him, and tried to catch him. He ran
under the barn; then came out, sprang through the fence, and so got
clear.

[Illustration]

I will tell you of a smart thing that my red cow does. When she goes
for a drink and finds the trough empty, she takes hold of the handle
with her horns, and pumps the water.

While I was waiting for a train at the station, the other day, a boy
with a little dog came in to wait also. The poor dog was afraid, and
tried very hard to get away; but the boy held him fast by a stout
string.

[Illustration]

There is one very selfish little chicken in my barn. When the other
chickens are just going to sleep, this selfish little chick pecks
them, and drives them down from the roost. He is very naughty, and
wants the roost all to himself.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
