THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW.


          _Alice._--One of your old-world stories, Uncle John,
        Such as you tell us by the winter fire,
        Till we all wonder it has grown so late.

          _Uncle John._--The story of the witch that ground to death
        Two children in her mill, or will you have
        The tale of Goody Cutpurse?

          _Alice._--                Nay, now, nay;
        Those stories are too childish, Uncle John,
        Too childish even for little Willy here,
        And I am older, two good years, than he;
        No, let us have a tale of elves that ride,
        By night, with jingling reins, or gnomes of the mine,
        Or water-fairies, such as you know how
        To spin, till Willy's eyes forget to wink,
        And good Aunt Mary, busy as she is,
        Lays down her knitting.

          _Uncle John._--       Listen to me, then.
        'Twas in the olden time, long, long ago,
        And long before the great oak at our door
        Was yet an acorn, on a mountain's side
        Lived, with his wife, a cottager. They dwelt
        Beside a glen and near a dashing brook,
        A pleasant spot in spring, where first the wren
        Was heard to chatter, and, among the grass,
        Flowers opened earliest; but, when winter came,
        That little brook was fringed with other flowers,--
        White flowers, with crystal leaf and stem, that grew
        In clear November nights. And, later still,
        That mountain glen was filled with drifted snows
        From side to side, that one might walk across,
        While, many a fathom deep, below, the brook
        Sang to itself, and leaped and trotted on
        Unfrozen, o'er its pebbles, toward the vale.

          _Alice._--A mountain's side, you said; the Alps, perhaps,
        Or our own Alleghanies.

          _Uncle John._--       Not so fast,
        My young geographer, for then the Alps,
        With their broad pastures, haply were untrod
        Of herdsman's foot, and never human voice
        Had sounded in the woods that overhang
        Our Alleghany's streams. I think it was
        Upon the slopes of the great Caucasus,
        Or where the rivulets of Ararat
        Seek the Armenian vales. That mountain rose
        So high, that, on its top, the winter snow
        Was never melted, and the cottagers
        Among the summer blossoms, far below,
        Saw its white peaks in August from their door.

[Illustration]

          One little maiden, in that cottage home,
        Dwelt with her parents, light of heart and limb,
        Bright, restless, thoughtless, flitting here and there,
        Like sunshine on the uneasy ocean waves,
        And sometimes she forgot what she was bid,
        As Alice does.

[Illustration]

          _Alice._--   Or Willy, quite as oft.

          _Uncle John._--But you are older, Alice, two good years,
        And should be wiser. Eva was the name
        Of this young maiden, now twelve summers old.
        Now you must know that, in those early times,
        When autumn days grew pale, there came a troop
        Of childlike forms from that cold mountain top;
        With trailing garments through the air they came,
        Or walked the ground with girded loins, and threw
        Spangles of silvery frost upon the grass,
        And edged the brook with glistening parapets,
        And built it crystal bridges, touched the pool,
        And turned its face to glass, or, rising thence,
        They shook, from their full laps, the soft, light snow,
        And buried the great earth, as autumn winds
        Bury the forest floor in heaps of leaves.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          A beautiful race were they, with baby brows,
        And fair, bright locks, and voices like the sound
        Of steps on the crisp snow, in which they talked
        With man, as friend with friend. A merry sight
        It was, when, crowding round the traveller,
        They smote him with their heaviest snow-flakes, flung
        Needles of frost in handfuls at his cheeks,
        And, of the light wreaths of his smoking breath,
        Wove a white fringe for his brown beard, and laughed
        Their slender laugh to see him wink and grin
        And make grim faces as he floundered on.
        But, when the spring came on, what terror reigned
        Among these Little People of the Snow!
        To them the sun's warm beams were shafts of fire,
        And the soft south wind was the wind of death.
        Away they flew, all with a pretty scowl
        Upon their childish faces, to the north,
        Or scampered upward to the mountain's top,
        And there defied their enemy, the Spring;
        Skipping and dancing on the frozen peaks,
        And moulding little snow-balls in their palms,
        And rolling them, to crush her flowers below,
        Down the steep snow-fields.

[Illustration]

          _Alice._--                That, too, must have been
        A merry sight to look at.

          _Uncle John._--         You are right,
        But I must speak of graver matters now.

[Illustration]

          Mid-winter was the time, and Eva stood,
        Within the cottage, all prepared to dare
        The outer cold, with ample furry robe
        Close belted round her waist, and boots of fur,
        And a broad kerchief, which her mother's hand
        Had closely drawn about her ruddy cheek.
        "Now, stay not long abroad," said the good dame,
        "For sharp is the outer air, and, mark me well,
        Go not upon the snow beyond the spot
        Where the great linden bounds the neighboring field."

[Illustration]

          The little maiden promised, and went forth,
        And climbed the rounded snow-swells firm with frost
        Beneath her feet, and slid, with balancing arms,
        Into the hollows. Once, as up a drift
        She slowly rose, before her, in the way,
        She saw a little creature lily-cheeked,
        With flowing flaxen locks, and faint blue eyes,
        That gleamed like ice, and robe that only seemed
        Of a more shadowy whiteness than her cheek.
        On a smooth bank she sat.

[Illustration]

          _Alice._--              She must have been
        One of your Little People of the Snow.

          _Uncle John._--She was so, and, as Eva now drew near
        The tiny creature bounded from her seat;
        "And come," she said, "my pretty friend; to-day
        We will be playmates. I have watched thee long,
        And seen how well thou lov'st to walk these drifts,
        And scoop their fair sides into little cells,
        And carve them with quaint figures, huge-limbed men,
        Lions, and griffins. We will have, to-day,
        A merry ramble over these bright fields,
        And thou shalt see what thou hast never seen."

[Illustration]

          On went the pair, until they reached the bound
        Where the great linden stood, set deep in snow,
        Up to the lower branches. "Here we stop,"
        Said Eva, "for my mother has my word
        That I will go no further than this tree."
        Then the snow-maiden laughed: "And what is this?
        This fear of the pure snow, the innocent snow,
        That never harmed aught living? Thou mayst roam
        For leagues beyond this garden, and return
        In safety; here the grim wolf never prowls,
        And here the eagle of our mountain-crags
        Preys not in winter. I will show the way
        And bring thee safely home. Thy mother, sure,
        Counselled thee thus because thou hadst no guide."

[Illustration]

          By such smooth words was Eva won to break
        Her promise, and went on with her new friend,
        Over the glistening snow and down a bank
        Where a white shelf, wrought by the eddying wind,
        Like to a billow's crest in the great sea,
        Curtained an opening. "Look, we enter here."
        And straight, beneath the fair o'erhanging fold,
        Entered the little pair that hill of snow,
        Walking along a passage with white walls,
        And a white vault above where snow-stars shed
        A wintry twilight. Eva moved in awe,
        And held her peace, but the snow-maiden smiled,
        And talked and tripped along, as, down the way,
        Deeper they went into that mountainous drift.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          And now the white walls widened, and the vault
        Swelled upward, like some vast cathedral dome,
        Such as the Florentine, who bore the name
        Of heaven's most potent angel, reared, long since,
        Or the unknown builder of that wondrous fane,
        The glory of Burgos. Here a garden lay,
        In which the Little People of the Snow
        Were wont to take their pastime when their tasks
        Upon the mountain's side and in the clouds
        Were ended. Here they taught the silent frost
        To mock, in stem and spray, and leaf and flower,
        The growths of summer. Here the palm upreared
        Its white columnar trunk and spotless sheaf
        Of plume-like leaves; here cedars, huge as those
        Of Lebanon, stretched far their level boughs,
        Yet pale and shadowless; the sturdy oak
        Stood, with its huge gnarled roots of seeming strength,
        Fast anchored, in the glistening bank; light sprays
        Of myrtle, roses in their bud and bloom,
        Drooped by the winding walks; yet all seemed wrought
        Of stainless alabaster; up the trees
        Ran the lithe jessamine, with stalk and leaf
        Colorless as her flowers. "Go softly on,"
        Said the snow-maiden; "touch not, with thy hand,
        The frail creation round thee, and beware
        To sweep it with thy skirts. Now look above.
        How sumptuously these bowers are lighted up
        With shifting gleams that softly come and go!
        These are the northern lights, such as thou seest
        In the midwinter nights, cold, wandering flames,
        That float, with our processions, through the air;
        And here, within our winter palaces,
        Mimic the glorious daybreak." Then she told
        How, when the wind, in the long winter nights,
        Swept the light snows into the hollow dell,
        She and her comrades guided to its place
        Each wandering flake, and piled them quaintly up,
        In shapely colonnade and glistening arch,
        With shadowy aisles between, or bade them grow
        Beneath their little hands, to bowery walks
        In gardens such as these, and, o'er them all,
        Built the broad roof. "But thou hast yet to see
        A fairer sight," she said, and led the way
        To where a window of pellucid ice
        Stood in the wall of snow, beside their path.
        "Look, but thou mayst not enter." Eva looked,
        And lo! a glorious hall, from whose high vault
        Stripes of soft light, ruddy, and delicate green,
        And tender blue, flowed downward to the floor
        And far around, as if the aerial hosts,
        That march on high by night, with beamy spears,
        And streaming banners, to that place had brought
        Their radiant flags to grace a festival.

          And in all that hall a joyous multitude
        Of those by whom its glistening walls were reared,
        Whirled in a merry dance to silvery sounds,
        That rang from cymbals of transparent ice,
        And ice-cups, quivering to the skilful touch
        Of little fingers. Round and round they flew,
        As when, in spring, about a chimney-top,
        A cloud of twittering swallows, just returned,
        Wheel round and round, and turn and wheel again,
        Unwinding their swift track. So rapidly
        Flowed the meandering stream of that fair dance,
        Beneath that dome of light. Bright eyes that looked
        From under lily brows, and gauzy scarfs
        Sparkling like snow-wreaths in the early sun,
        Shot by the window in their mazy whirl.
        And there stood Eva, wondering at the sight
        Of those bright revellers and that graceful sweep
        Of motion as they passed her;--long she gazed,
        And listened long to the sweet sounds that thrilled
        The frosty air, till now the encroaching cold
        Recalled her to herself. "Too long, too long
        I linger here," she said, and then she sprang
        Into the path, and with a hurried step
        Followed it upward. Ever by her side
        Her little guide kept pace. As on they went
        Eva bemoaned her fault: "What must they think--
        The dear ones in the cottage, while so long,
        Hour after hour, I stay without? I know
        That they will seek me far and near, and weep
        To find me not. How could I, wickedly,
        Neglect the charge they gave me?" As she spoke,
        The hot tears started to her eyes; she knelt
        In the mid path. "Father! forgive this sin;
        Forgive myself I cannot"--thus she prayed,
        And rose and hastened onward. When, at last,
        They reached the outer air, the clear north breathed
        A bitter cold, from which she shrank with dread,
        But the snow-maiden bounded as she felt
        The cutting blast, and uttered shouts of joy,
        And skipped, with boundless glee, from drift to drift,
        And danced round Eva, as she labored up
        The mounds of snow, "Ah me! I feel my eyes
        Grow heavy," Eva said; "they swim with sleep;
        I cannot walk for utter weariness,
        And I must rest a moment on this bank,
        But let it not be long." As thus she spoke,
        In half-formed words, she sank on the smooth snow,
        With closing lids. Her guide composed the robe
        About her limbs, and said, "A pleasant spot
        Is this to slumber in; on such a couch
        Oft have I slept away the winter night,
        And had the sweetest dreams." So Eva slept,
        But slept in death; for when the power of frost
        Locks up the motions of the living frame,
        The victim passes to the realm of Death
        Through the dim porch of Sleep. The little guide,
        Watching beside her, saw the hues of life
        Fade from the fair smooth brow and rounded cheek,
        As fades the crimson from a morning cloud,
        Till they were white as marble, and the breath
        Had ceased to come and go, yet knew she not
        At first that this was death. But when she marked
        How deep the paleness was, how motionless
        That once lithe form, a fear came over her.
        She strove to wake the sleeper, plucked her robe,
        And shouted in her ear, but all in vain;
        The life had passed away from those young limbs.
        Then the snow-maiden raised a wailing cry,
        Such as a dweller in some lonely wild,
        Sleepless through all the long December night,
        Hears when the mournful East begins to blow.

          But suddenly was heard the sound of steps,
        Grating on the crisp snow; the cottagers
        Were seeking Eva; from afar they saw
        The twain, and hurried toward them. As they came,
        With gentle chidings ready on their lips,
        And marked that death-like sleep, and heard the tale
        Of the snow-maiden, mortal anguish fell
        Upon their hearts, and bitter words of grief
        And blame were uttered: "Cruel, cruel one,
        To tempt our daughter thus, and cruel we,
        Who suffered her to wander forth alone
        In this fierce cold." They lifted the dear child,
        And bore her home and chafed her tender limbs,
        And strove, by all the simple arts they knew,
        To make the chilled blood move, and win the breath
        Back to her bosom; fruitlessly they strove.
        The little maid was dead. In blank despair
        They stood, and gazed at her who never more
        Should look on them. "Why die we not with her?"
        They said; "without her life is bitterness."

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          Now came the funeral day; the simple folk
        Of all that pastoral region gathered round,
        To share the sorrow of the cottagers.
        They carved a way into the mound of snow
        To the glen's side, and dug a little grave
        In the smooth slope, and, following the bier,
        In long procession from the silent door,
        Chanted a sad and solemn melody.

[Illustration]

          "Lay her away to rest within the ground.
        Yea, lay her down whose pure and innocent life
        Was spotless as these snows; for she was reared
        In love, and passed in love life's pleasant spring,
        And all that now our tenderest love can do
        Is to give burial to her lifeless limbs."

          They paused. A thousand slender voices round,
        Like echoes softly flung from rock and hill,
        Took up the strain, and all the hollow air
        Seemed mourning for the dead; for, on that day,
        The little people of the snow had come,
        From mountain-peak, and cloud, and icy hall,
        To Eva's burial. As the murmur died,
        The funeral train renewed the solemn chant.

[Illustration]

          "Thou, Lord, hast taken her to be with Eve,
        Whose gentle name was given her. Even so,
        For so Thy wisdom saw that it was best
        For her and us. We bring our bleeding hearts,
        And ask the touch of healing from Thy hand,
        As, with submissive tears, we render back
        The lovely and beloved to Him who gave."

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          They ceased. Again the plaintive murmur rose.
        From shadowy skirts of low-hung cloud it came,
        And wide white fields, and fir-trees capped with snow,
        Shivering to the sad sounds. They sank away
        To silence in the dim-seen distant woods.
        The little grave was closed; the funeral train
        Departed; winter wore away; the spring
        Steeped, with her quickening rains, the violet tufts,
        By fond hands planted where the maiden slept.
        But, after Eva's burial, never more
        The Little People of the Snow were seen
        By human eye, nor ever human ear
        Heard from their lips, articulate speech again;
        For a decree went forth to cut them off,
        Forever, from communion with mankind.
        The winter clouds, along the mountain-side,
        Rolled downward toward the vale, but no fair form
        Leaned from their folds, and, in the icy glens,
        And aged woods, under snow-loaded pines,
        Where once they made their haunt, was emptiness.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          But ever, when the wintry days drew near,
        Around that little grave, in the long night,
        Frost-wreaths were laid and tufts of silvery rime
        In shape like blades and blossoms of the field,
        As one would scatter flowers upon a bier.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
