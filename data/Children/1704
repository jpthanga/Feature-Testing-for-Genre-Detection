[Illustration: Introduction]


_INTRODUCTION_


  Children, although you might expect
  My manners to be quite correct
  (For since I fancy I can teach,
  I ought to practice what I preach),
  'Tis true that I have often braved
  My mother's wrath, and misbehaved!
  And almost every single rule
  I broke, before I went to school!
  For that is how I learned the way
  To teach you etiquette to-day.
  So when you chance to take a look
  At all the maxims in the book,
  You'll see that most of them are true,
  I found them out, and so will you,
  For if you are as GOOP derided,
  You may perhaps reform, as I did!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Window-Smoochers]


_WINDOW-SMOOCHERS_


  Little Goops are marking
    On the window pane;
    I forbid, in vain!
  Noses, when they're greasy,
  Leave a smooch so easy!
    Rub it out again!
  I shall have to scold them,
  For I've often told them,
    Kindly, to refrain!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: A Low Trick]


_A LOW TRICK_


  The meanest trick I ever knew
  Was one I know _you_ never do.
  I saw a Goop once try to do it,
  And there was nothing funny to it.
  He pulled a chair from under me
  As I was sitting down; but he
  Was sent to bed, and rightly, too.
  It was a _horrid_ thing to do!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: When To Go]


_WHEN TO GO_


  When you go a-calling,
    Never stay too late;
  You will wear your welcome out
    If you hesitate!
  Just before they're tired of you,
    Just before they yawn,
  Before they think you are a Goop,
    And wish that you were gone,
  While they're laughing with you,
    While they like you so,
  While they want to keep you,--
    _That's_ the time to go!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: "Ain't"]


_"AIN'T"_


  Now "ain't" is a word
  That is very absurd
   To use for an "isn't" or "aren't."
  Ask Teacher about it:
  She'll say, "Do without it!"
   I wish you would see if you can't!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Nell the Nibbler]


_NELL THE NIBBLER_


  She ate some chocolate drops at 1,
    At 2, she thought she'd take
  A little jelly and a bun;
    At 3, some frosted cake.

  At 4, she nibbled at a roll;
    At 5, a doughnut spied,
  And ate it (all except the hole),
    And then some cookies tried.

  At 6, she didn't feel quite right,
    And didn't care for dinner.
  She said she had no appetite,
    With so much Goop-food in her!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Justice]


_JUSTICE_


  Whenever brother's sent to bed,
    Or punished, do not go
  And peer at him and jeer at him,
    And say, "I told you so!"

  Nor should you try to make him laugh
    When he has been so bad;
  Let him confess his naughtiness
    Before you both are glad!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: A Puzzle]


_A PUZZLE_


  There are about a thousand things
    I'm not allowed to do;
  Most everything I'm fondest of
    I'm told is wrong--are you?

  They say, "_Please don't do that, my child!_"
    They say, "_You mustn't, dear!_"
 I hope sometime I'll learn what's right,
   For now it seems so queer!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Frankness]


_FRANKNESS_


  When you are talking, I expect
  You'd better hold your head erect!
  Please look me squarely in the eye
  Unless you're telling me a lie.
  For if you crouch and look askance,
  Regarding me with sidelong glance,
  I'll think it is a Goop I see
  Who is _afraid_ to look at me!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: The Duty of the Strong]


_THE  DUTY OF  THE  STRONG_


  You who are the oldest,
  You who are the tallest,
  Don't you think you ought to help
  The youngest and the smallest?

  You who are the strongest,
  You who are the quickest,
  Don't you think you ought to help
  The weakest and the sickest?

  Never mind the trouble,
  Help them all you can;
  Be a little woman!
  Be a little man!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Walking With Papa]


_WALKING WITH PAPA_


  "Won't you walk a little farther?"
    Said a Goop to his Papa;
  "It is really quite delightful,
    And we haven't travelled far;
  Wont you walk a little farther,
    There's a house I'd like to see!
  Won't you walk a little farther,
    Till we reach that cherry-tree?"

  "Won't you carry me? I'm tired!"
    Whined a Goop to his Papa;
  "And my feet are sore and weary,
    And we've gone so _very_ far!
  Won't you carry me? I'm tired!
    And I _can't_ walk back alone!
  Won't you carry me? I'm tired!"
    And the Goop began to groan.




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Piano Torture]


_PIANO TORTURE_


  Pianos are considered toys
  By Goops, and naughty girls and boys;
    They pound upon the keys,
  They lift the cover up, on top,
  To see the little jiggers hop,
    And both the pedals squeeze!

  But instruments so rich and fine
  (Especially if they're not mine)
    I ought to treat with care;
  So when my elder sister plays
  She'll find it is in tune always,
   Nor injured anywhere!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: At Table]


_AT TABLE_

  Why is it Goops must always wish
  To touch _each_ apple on the dish?
  Why do they never neatly fold
  Their napkins until they are told?
  Why do they play with food, and bite
  Such awful mouthfuls?  Is it right?
  Why do they tilt back in their chairs?
  _Because they're Goops!_ So no one cares!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: How to Eat Soup]


_HOW TO EAT SOUP_

  Whenever you are eating soup
  Remember not to be a Goop!
  And if you think to say this rhyme,
  Perhaps 'twill help you every time:

  _Like little boats that put to sea,
  I push my spoon AWAY from me;
  I do not tilt my dish, nor scrape
  The last few drops, like hungry ape!_

  _Like little boats, that, almost filled,
  Come back without their cargoes spilled,
  My spoon sails gently to my lips,
  Unloading from the SIDE, like ships._




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Baby's Apology]


_BABY'S APOLOGY_


  Dear little seed, queer little seed,
   Tucked into bed in the garden,
  Why don't you grow? Why, don't you know
    Baby is asking your pardon?

  Out, little seed! Sprout, little seed!
   Baby did wrong without knowing!
  Hoping for you, groping for you,
   To see if you _really_ were growing.

  Break, little seed! Wake, little seed!
   Baby will watch and not harm you.
  Everything's bright, everything's right,
    Nothing is here to alarm you.

  Dress, little seed! Yes, little seed,
    Fold your green leaflets around you;
  _There_, little seed! Fair little seed,
    Baby's _so_ glad he has found you!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: In the Street]


_IN THE  STREET_


  Peelings on the sidewalk,
    Apple-cores and all,
  Kick them in the gutter;
    Save some one a fall!
  Barrel hoops, glass, and cans,
    And wires in the street,
  Kick them in the gutter;
    You'll save some horse's feet!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Sick Furniture]


_SICK FURNITURE_


  Sitting on the table,
  Standing on the chairs,
  That's the way the legs are broken and the cushion tears!
  How'd you like to pay the bill for varnish and repairs?




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Borrowed Plumes]


_BORROWED PLUMES_


  Don't try on the wraps,
  The bonnets and caps
    Of company coming to call!
  Admire, if you please,
  But garments like these
    Should always feel safe in the hall!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: The Goop Picnic]


_THE GOOP PICNIC_


  They came to the best sort of place for a rest,
    On the grass, with the trees overhead,
  They sat down in a bunch and they opened their lunch,
    And they had a be-autiful spread!

  And when they were done, and they'd had all their fun,
    They proved they were Goops, or were blind;
  For they picked up their wraps and they left all their scraps
    For the _next_ picnic party to find!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Book Manners]


_BOOK-MANNERS_


  If you scribble on your books,
  How disgustable it looks!
  Here a word, and there a scrawl,
  Silly pictures over all!
  Take a paper, or a slate,
  If you want to decorate!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Poor Mother!]


_POOR MOTHER!_


  Oh! Isn't it shocking!
  Just look at your stocking!
    Just look at your brand new boots!
  Your waist is all torn
  And your trousers are worn--
    Just _look_ at the holes in your suits!

  Your father is working
  All day, without shirking,
    To pay for the clothes that you wear;
  Your mother is mending
  All day, and attending
    To you, with the kindest of care.

  And so, while you're playing,
  Think of father, who's paying,
    And mother, who's working so hard;
  While you kneel on your knees,
  Or climb up the trees,
    Or make your mud pies in the yard!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Cheating]


_CHEATING_


  I thought I saw a little Goop
    Who didn't pay his fare;
  I looked again; the passengers
    Were gazing at him, there.
  "They think that he's a thief!" I said;
    "I wonder does he care?"




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Goop! Goop! Goop!]


_GOOP! GOOP! GOOP!_


  Goop! Goop! Goop!
    I wish you'd wash your face!
  Goop! Goop! Goop!
    Your hands are a disgrace!
  Goop! Goop! Goop!
    Put things back in their place!
  I wish you were polite,
    Instead of a
  Goop! Goop! Goop!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Visiting]


_VISITING_

  When a Goop goes out to visit,
  'T isn't very pleasant, is it,
    To hear him ask his friends for things to eat?
  And to hear the little sinner
  Say he wants to stay to dinner
    Is a piece of impoliteness hard to beat!

  "_Mother said that I could stay_
  _If you asked me!_" is the way
    That a Goop will make them ask him to remain.
  It is better to be slighted
  Than to stay when not invited,
    For they _never_ ask a Goop to come again!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Picking and Stealing]


_PICKING and STEALING_


  When you are fetching bread, I trust
  You never nibble at the crust

  When in the kitchen, do you linger
  And pinch the cookies with your finger?

  Or do you peck the frosted cake?
  Don't do it, please, for Mother's sake!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Loyalty]


_LOYALTY_

  Mother's found your mischief out!
    What are you going to do?
  Cry and sulk, or kick and shout?
  Tell your mother all about
    Brother's mischief, too?

  Or,
  Take your punishment, and say,
    "I'll be better, now!"
  Never mind the horrid way
  Brother treated you, at play;
    Don't tell it, anyhow!

  It is the Goops, who have no shame,
  Who say, "_'Twas some one else to blame!_"




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Indolence]


_INDOLENCE_


  There was a Goop who lay in bed
  Till half-past eight, the sleepy-head!
  He couldn't find his stockings, for
  He'd thrown them somewhere on the floor!
  He couldn't find his reading-book;
  He had forgotten where to look!
  His breakfast grew so very cold,
  This lazy Goop began to scold;
  And then he blamed his mother, kind!
  "_You made me late to school_!" he whined.




[Illustration]

[Illustration: The Law of Hospitality]


_THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY_


  There is a very simple rule
    That every one should know;
  You may not hear of it in school,
    But everywhere you go,
  In every land where people dwell,
    And men are good and true,
  You'll find they understand it well,
    And so I'll tell it you:

  _To every one who gives me food,
    Or shares his home with me,
  I owe a debt of gratitude,
    And I must loyal be.
  I may not laugh at him, or say
    Of him a word unkind;
  His friendliness I must repay,
    And to his faults be blind!_




[Illustration]

[Illustration: The Flower Hospital]


_THE FLOWER HOSPITAL_


  I dreamed I found a sunlit room
  Filled with a delicate perfume,
  Where, moaning their sweet lives away,
  A thousand lovely flowers lay.
  They drooped, so pale, and wan, and weak,
  With hardly strength enough to speak,
  With stems so crushed and leaves so torn
  It was too dreadful to be borne!
  And one white lily raised her head
  From off her snowy flower bed.
  And sighed, "_Please tell the children, oh!
  They should not treat the flowers so!
  They plucked us when we were so gay,
  And then they threw us all away
  To wither in the sun all day!
  We all must fade, but we'll forgive
  If they'll let other flowers live_!"




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Puppy Goops]


_PUPPY GOOPS_


  Candy in the cushions
    Of the easy-chair;
  Raisins in the sofa--
    How did they get there?
  The little Goop who's greedy
    Does it every day,
  Like a little puppy,
    Hiding bones away!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Exaggeration]


_EXAGGERATION_


  Don't try to tell a story
    To beat the one you've heard;
  For if you try, you're apt to lie,
    And _that_ would be absurd!

  Don't try to be more funny
    Than any one in school;
  For if you're not, they'll laugh a lot,
    And think you are a fool!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Noise! Noise! Noise!]


_NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!_


  Do you slam the door?
    Do you drag your feet?
  Making noise enough for four
  Hundred thousand Goops, or more,
    Tearing up the street?

  Clattering down the stairs,
    Storming through the hall,
  Pounding floors, upsetting chairs,
  Do you think your father cares
    For your noise, at all?




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Stealing Rides]


_STEALING RIDES_


  I thought I saw a little Goop
    Who hung behind a cart;
  I looked again. He'd fallen off!
    It gave me _such_ a start!
  "If he were killed, some day," I said,
    "'Twould break his mother's heart!"




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Untidy Goops]


_UNTIDY GOOPS_


  I think you are a Goop, because
  You never shut your bureau drawers,
    You do not close the door!
  You leave your water in the bowl,
  You put your peelings in the coal!
    I've told you _that_ before!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: A Goop Party]


_A GOOP PARTY_


  "Please come to my party!" said Jenny to Prue;
  "I'm going to have Willy, and Nelly, and you;
  I'm going to have candy and cake and ice-cream,
  We'll play _Hunt-the-Slipper_, we'll laugh and we'll scream.
  We'll dress up in caps, we'll have stories and tricks,
  And you won't have to go till a quarter past six!"
  But alas! When she mentioned her party, at tea,
  Her mother said, "No! It can't possibly be!"
  So Jane had to go and explain to her friends,
  And that is how many a Goop party ends!
  Just speak to your mother _before_ you invite,
  And then it's more likely to happen all right!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Inquisitiveness]


_INQUISITIVENESS_

  I gave a letter to a Goop
    To take to Mrs. Bird;
  And what d'you think he went and did?
    He read it, every word!
  Now, isn't that the rudest thing
    That you have ever heard?

  Why, he would peep through keyholes,
    And listen at the door!
  And open parcels, just to see
    What came from every store!

  Now, have you ever _ever_ heard
    Of such a Goop before?




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Don't be Good]


_DON'T BE GOOD_


  Just because you want to go
  To the circus, or the show;
  But, when all your fun is o'er,
  Be as good as you were before!


[Illustration: Don't be Bad]


_DON'T BE  BAD_

  Just as long as you dare to be,
  Because your mother doesn't see.
  Do not wait for her to scold,
  But be just as good as gold!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Write Right!]


_WRITE RIGHT!_


  If you were writing with your nose,
  You'd _have_ to curl up, I suppose,
  And lay your head upon your hand;
  But now, I cannot understand,
  For you are writing with your pen!
  So sit erect, and smile again!
  You need not scowl because you write,
  Nor hold your fingers _quite_ so tight!
  And if you gnaw the holder so,
  They'll take you for a Goop, you know!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Wet Feet]


_WET FEET_


  Down the street together,
  In the rainy weather,
    Went a pair of little boys along;
  One of them went straying
  In the gutters playing,
    Doing all his mother said was wrong;

  One of them went dashing
  Into puddles splashing,
    Under dripping eaves that soaked him through;
  One of them avoided
  All the other boy did,
    Dodging all the slimy, slushy goo.

  One of them grew chilly;
  Said he felt so ill he
    Knew he'd caught a cold, and coughed a lot!
  The other was so warm he
  Said he _liked_ it stormy!
    Which of them was Goop, and which was not?




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Dress Quickly!]


_DRESS QUICKLY!_


  All your life you'll have to dress,
  Every single day (unless
  You should happen to be sick),
  Why not learn to do it quick?
  Hang your clothes the proper way,
  So you'll find them fresh next day;
  Treat them with a little care,
  Fold them neatly on a chair;
  So, without a bit of worry,
  You can dress in quite a hurry.
  Think of the slovenly Goops, before
  You strew your clothing on the floor!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Danger!]


_DANGER!_


  Ink, ink! What do you think!
  You're sure to be stained, if you play with the ink!
  You're sure to get black, if you play with the ink-well,
  Before you begin it, just stop once, and think well!
  All over your fingers, all over your face,
  All over your clothes, and all over the place!
  Your mother'll be angry, your father'll say, "_There!
  I said not to touch it; you said you'd take care!_"

  When Goops are so mischievous, they have to drink
  Forty-four dozen bottles of raven black ink!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: The Reason Why]


_THE  REASON WHY_


  Everybody liked Ezekiel.
    Why?
  You could scarcely find his equal.
    Why?
  If he made a mistake,
    He said he was wrong;
  If he went on an errand,
    He wasn't gone long;
  He never would bully,
    Although he was strong!

  Everybody hated Mello.
    Why?
  He was such a surly fellow.
    Why?
  If you asked him for candy,
    He'd hide his away;
  He never would play
    What the rest wished to play;
  He would say _horrid_ words
    That he oughtn't to say!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: In Goop Attire]


_IN GOOP ATTIRE_


  I'll make you a dress of a towel,
    And trim it all over with soap,
  With a sponge for a hat
  And a wet one, at that!
    And _then_ you'll be happy, I hope!
  You may act like a Goop, if you please,
  In garments constructed like these!

  But now, while you're dressed up so neatly,
    Don't wipe off your hands on your frock!
  The smooching that lingers
  When you wipe off your fingers,
    Will give your dear mother a shock!
  The result will be even more shocking,
  If you wipe off your shoes on your stocking!




[Illustration]

[Illustration: Impossible!]


_IMPOSSIBLE!_


  There once was a Goop (_it is hard to believe
    Such unpleasant behavior of you!_)
  Who always was wiping his nose on his sleeve;
    _I hope that this Goop wasn't you!_
  He always was spitting (for fun, I suppose),
    _I couldn't believe, it of you!_
  And putting his fingers up into his nose;
    _I KNOW that this Goop wasn't you!_

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
