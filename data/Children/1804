A Defective Santa Claus


  Allus when our Pa he's away
  Nen Uncle Sidney comes to stay
  At our house here--so Ma an' me
  An' Etty an' Lee-Bob won't be
  Afeard ef anything at night
  Might happen--like Ma says it might.

  (Ef _Trip_ wuz _big_, I bet you he
  'Uz best watch-dog you ever see!)
  An' so last winter--ist before
  It's go' be Chris'mus-Day,--w'y, shore
  Enough, Pa had to haf to go
  To 'tend a lawsuit--"An' the snow
  Ist right fer Santy Claus!" Pa said,
  As he clumb in old Ayersuz' sled,
  An' said he's sorry _he_ can't be
  With us that night--"'Cause," he-says-ee,
  "Old Santy _might_ be comin' here--
  This very night of all the year

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  _I'_ got to be away!--so all
  You kids must tell him--ef he call--
  He's mighty welcome, an' yer Pa
  He left his love with you an' Ma

  An' Uncle Sid!" An' clucked, an' leant
  Back, laughin'--an' away they went!
  An' Uncle wave' his hands an' yells
  "Yer old horse ort to have on bells!"
  But Pa yell back an' laugh an' say
  "I 'spect when _Santy_ come this way
  It's time enough fer sleighbells nen!"
  An' holler back "Good-by!" again,
  An' reach out with the driver's whip
  An' cut behind an' drive back Trip.

  An' so all day it snowed an' snowed!
  An' Lee-Bob he ist watched the road,

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  In his high-chair; an' Etty she
  U'd play with Uncle Sid an' me--
  Like she wuz he'ppin' fetch in wood
  An' keepin' old fire goin' good,

  Where Ma she wuz a-cookin' there
  An' kitchen, too, an' ever'where!
  An' Uncle say, "'At's ist the way
  Yer Ma's b'en workin', night an' day,
  Sence she hain't big as Etty is
  Er Lee-Bob in that chair o' his!"
  Nen Ma she'd laugh 't what Uncle said,
  An' smack an' smoove his old bald head
  An' say "Clear out the way till I
  Can keep that pot from b'ilin' dry!"
  Nen Uncle, when she's gone back to
  The kitchen, says, "We _ust_ to do

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Some cookin' in the _ashes_.--_Say_,
  S'posin' we try some, thataway!"
  An' nen he send us to tell Ma
  Send two big 'taters in he saw

  Pa's b'en a-keepin' 'cause they got
  The premiun at the Fair. An' what
  You think?--He rake a grea'-big hole
  In the hot ashes, an' he roll
  Them old big 'taters in the place
  An' rake the coals back--an' his face
  Ist swettin' so's he purt'-nigh swear
  'Cause it's so hot! An' when they're there
  'Bout time 'at we fergit 'em, he
  Ist rake 'em out again--an' _gee_!--
  He bu'st 'em with his fist wite on
  A' old stove-led, while Etty's gone

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  To git the salt, an' butter, too--
  Ist like he said she haf to do,
  No matter what _Ma_ say! An' so
  He salt an' butter 'em, an' blow

  'Em cool enough fer us to eat--
  An' _me_-o-_my_! they're hard to beat!
  An' Trip 'ud ist lay there an' pant
  Like he'd laugh _out loud_, but he can't.
  Nen Uncle fill his pipe--an' we
  'Ud he'p him light it--Sis an' me,--
  But mostly little Lee-Bob, 'cause
  "He's the best _Lighter_ ever wuz!"
  Like Uncle telled him wunst when Lee-
  Bob cried an' jerked the light from me,
  He wuz so mad! So Uncle pat
  An' pet him. (Lee-Bob's ust to that--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  'Cause he's the _little_-est, you know,
  An' allus has b'en humored so!)
  Nen Uncle gits the flat-arn out,
  An', while he's tellin' us all 'bout

  Old Chris'mus-times when _he's_ a kid,
  He ist cracked hickernuts, he did,
  Till they's a crockful, mighty nigh!
  An' when they're all done by an' by,
  He raked the red coals out again
  An' telled me, "Fetch that popcorn in,
  An' old three-leggud skillut--an'
  The _led_ an' all now, little man,--
  An' yer old Uncle here 'ull show
  You how corn's popped, long years ago
  When me an' Santy Claus wuz boys
  On Pap's old place in Illinoise!--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  An' your Pa, too, wuz chums, all through,
  With Santy!--Wisht Pa'd be here, too!"
  Nen Uncle sigh at Ma, an' she
  Pat him again, an' say to me

  An' Etty,--"You take warning fair!--
  Don't talk too much, like Uncle there,
  Ner don't fergit, like _him_, my dears,
  That 'little pitchers has big ears!'"
  But Uncle say to her, "Clear out!--
  Yer brother knows what he's about.--
  _You_ git your Chris'mus-cookin' done
  Er these pore childern won't have none!"
  Nen Trip wake up an' raise, an' nen
  Turn roun' an' nen lay down again.
  An' one time Uncle Sidney say,--
  "When dogs is sleepin' thataway,

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Like Trip, an' _whimpers_, it's a sign
  He'll ketch _eight_ rabbits--mayby _nine_--
  Afore his fleas'll wake him--nen
  He'll bite hisse'f to sleep again

  An _try_ to dream he's go' ketch _ten_."
  An' when Ma's gone again back in
  The kitchen, Uncle scratch his chin
  An' say, "When Santy Claus an' Pa
  An' me wuz little boys--an' Ma,
  When she's 'bout big as Etty there;--
  W'y,--'When we're _growed_--no matter _where_,'
  Santy he cross' his heart an' say,--
  'I'll come to see you, all, some day
  When _you'_ got childerns--all but me
  An' pore old Sid!'" Nen Uncle he
  Ist kindo' shade his eyes an' pour'

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  'Bout forty-'leven bushels more
  O' popcorn out the skillut there
  In Ma's new basket on the chair.
  An' nen he telled us--an' talk' low,

  "So Ma can't hear," he say:--"You know
  Yer _Pa_ know', when he drived away,
  Tomorry's go' be Chris'mus-_Day_;--
  Well, nen _tonight_," he whisper, "see?--
  It's go' be Chris'mus-_Eve_," says-ee,
  "An', like yer Pa hint, when he went,
  Old Santy Claus (now hush!) he's sent
  Yer Pa a postul-card, an' write
  He's shorely go' be here tonight....
  That's why yer Pa's so bored to be
  _Away_ tonight, when Santy he
  Is go' be here, sleighbells an' all,

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  To make you kids a Chris'mus-call!"
  An' we're so glad to know _fer shore_
  He's comin', I roll on the floor--
  An' here come Trip a-waller'n' roun'

  An' purt'-nigh knock the clo'eshorse down!--
  An' Etty grab Lee-Bob an' prance
  All roun' the room like it's a dance--
  Till Ma she come an' march us nen
  To dinner, where we're _still_ again,
  But _tickled_ so we ist can't eat
  But pie, an' ist the hot mincemeat
  With raisins in.--But _Uncle_ et,
  An' _Ma_. An' there they set an' set
  Till purt'-nigh supper-time; nen we
  Tell him he's got to fix the Tree
  'Fore _Santy_ gits here, like he said.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  We go nen to the old woodshed--
  All bundled up, through the deep snow--
  "An' snowin' yet, _jee-rooshy-O_!"
  Uncle he said, an' he'p us wade

  Back where's the Chris'mus-Tree he's made
  Out of a little jackoak-top
  He git down at the sawmill-shop--
  An' Trip 'ud run ahead, you know,
  An' 'tend-like he 'uz _eatin'_ snow--
  When we all waddle back with it;
  An' Uncle set it up--an' git
  It wite in front the fireplace--'cause
  He says "'Tain't _so_ 'at Santy Claus
  Comes down _all_ chimblies,--least, tonight
  He's comin' in _this_ house all right--
  By the front-door, as ort to be!--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  We'll all be hid where we can _see_!"
  Nen he look up, an' he see Ma
  An' say, "It's ist too bad their _Pa_
  Can't be here, so's to see the fun

  The childern _will_ have, ever' one!"
  Well, _we_!--We hardly couldn't wait
  Till it wuz dusk, an' dark an' late
  Enough to light the lamp!--An' Lee-
  Bob light a candle on the Tree--
  "Ist _one_--'cause I'm 'The Lighter'!"--Nen
  He clumb on Uncle's knee again
  An' hug us _bofe_;--an' Etty git
  Her little chist an' set on it
  Wite clos't, while Uncle telled some more
  'Bout Santy Claus, an' clo'es he wore
  "_All maked o' furs, an' trimmed as white_

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  _As cotton is, er snow at night_!"
  An' nen, all sudden-like, he say,--
  "_Hush! Listen there! Hain't that a sleigh
  An' sleighbells jinglin'_?" Trip go "_whooh_!"

  Like _he_ hear bells an' _smell_ 'em, too.
  Nen we all listen.... An'-sir, shore
  Enough, we hear bells--more an' more
  A-jinglin' clos'ter--clos'ter still
  Down the old crook-road roun' the hill.
  An' Uncle he jumps up, an' all
  The chairs he jerks back by the wall
  An' th'ows a' overcoat an' pair
  O' winder-curtains over there
  An' says, "_Hide quick, er you're too late!--
  Them bells is stoppin' at the gate!--
  Git back o' them-'air chairs an' hide_,

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  _'Cause I hear Santy's voice outside_!"
  An' _Bang! bang! bang!_ we heerd the door--
  Nen it flewed open, an' the floor
  Blowed full o' snow--that's _first_ we saw,

  Till little Lee-Bob shriek' at Ma
  "_There's Santy Claus!--I know him by
  His big white mufftash!_"--an' ist cry
  An' laugh an' _squeal_ an' dance an' _yell_--
  Till, when he quiet down a spell,
  Old Santy bow an' th'ow a kiss
  To him--an' one to me an' Sis--
  An' nen go _clos't_ to Ma an' stoop
  An' kiss her--An' nen give a whoop
  That _fainted_ her!--'Cause when he bent
  An' kiss her, he ist backed an' went
  Wite 'ginst the Chris'mus-Tree ist where

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  The candle's at Lee-Bob lit there!--
  An' set his white-fur belt afire--
  An' blaze streaked roun' his waist an' higher
  Wite up his old white beard an' th'oat!--

  Nen Uncle grabs th' old overcoat
  An' flops it over Santy's head,
  An' swing the door wide back an' said,
  "Come out, old man!--an' _quick_ about
  It!--I've ist _got_ to put you out!"
  An' out he sprawled him in the snow--
  "Now _roll_!" he says--"_Hi-roll-ee-O_!"--
  An' Santy, sputter'n' "_Ouch! Gee-whiz!_"
  Ist roll an' roll fer all they is!
  An' Trip he's out there, too,--I know,
  'Cause I could hear him yappin' so--
  An' I heerd Santy, wunst er twic't,

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Say, as he's rollin', "_Drat the fice't_!"
  Nen Uncle come back in, an' shake
  Ma up, an' say, "Fer mercy-sake!--
  He hain't hurt none!" An' nen he said,--

  "You youngsters h'ist up-stairs to bed!--
  Here! kiss yer Ma 'Good-night,' an' me,--
  We'll he'p old Santy fix the Tree--
  An' all yer whistles, horns an' drums
  I'll he'p you toot when morning comes!"

       *       *       *       *       *

  It's long while 'fore we go to sleep,--
  'Cause down-stairs, all-time somepin' keep
  A-kindo' scufflin' roun' the floors--
  An' openin' doors, an' _shettin'_ doors--
  An' could hear Trip a-whinin', too,
  Like he don't know ist _what_ to do--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  An' tongs a-clankin' down _k'thump_!--
  Nen some one squonkin' the old pump--
  An' _Wooh!_ how cold it soun' out there!
  I could ist _see_ the pump-spout where

  It's got ice chin-whiskers all wet
  An' drippy--An' I see it yet!
  An' nen, seem-like, I hear some mens
  A-talkin' out there by the fence,
  An' one says, "Oh, 'bout twelve o'clock!"
  "Nen," 'nother'n says, "Here's to you, Doc!--
  _God bless us ever' one_!" An' nen
  I heerd the old pump squonk again.
  An' nen I say my prayer all through
  Like Uncle Sidney learn' me to,--
  "O Father mine, e'en as Thine own,
  This child looks up to Thee alone:

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Asleep or waking, give him still
  His Elder Brother's wish and will."
  An' that's the last I know.... Till Ma
  She's callin' us--an' so is _Pa_,--

  He holler "_Chris'mus-gif'_!" an' say,--
  "I'm got back home fer Chris'mus-Day!--
  An' Uncle Sid's here, too--an' he
  Is nibblin' 'roun' yer Chris'mus-Tree!"
  Nen _Uncle_ holler, "I suppose
  Yer Pa's so proud he's froze his nose
  He wants to turn it up at us,
  'Cause _Santy_ kick' up such a fuss--
  Tetchin' hisse'f off same as ef
  He wuz his own fireworks hisse'f!"

  An' when we're down-stairs,--shore enough,
  Pa's nose _is_ froze an' salve an' stuff

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  All on it--an' one hand's froze, too,
  An' got a old yarn red-and-blue
  Mitt on it--"An' he's froze some more
  Acrost his chist, an' kindo' sore

  All roun' his _dy_-fram," Uncle say.--
  "But Pa he'd ort a-seen the way
  _Santy_ bear up last night when that-
  Air fire break out, an' quicker'n _scat_
  He's all a-blazin', an' them-'air
  Gun-cotton whiskers that he wear
  Ist _flashin'_!--till I burn a hole
  In the snow with him, and he roll
  The front-yard dry as Chris'mus jokes
  Old parents plays on little folks!
  But, long's a smell o' tow er wool,
  I kep' him rollin' _beautiful_!--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

  Till I wuz _shore_ I _shorely_ see
  He's _squenched_! W'y, hadn't b'en fer _me_,
  That old man might a-burnt clear down
  Clean--plum'--level with the groun'!"

  Nen Ma say, "_There_, Sid; that'll do!--
  Breakfast is ready--_Chris'mus_, too.--
  Your voice 'ud soun' best, sayin' _Grace_--
  Say it." An' Uncle bow' his face
  An' say so long a _Blessing_ nen,
  Trip bark' _two_ times 'fore it's "A-men!"

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
