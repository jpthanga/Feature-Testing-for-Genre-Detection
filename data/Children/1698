THE MAN IN THE MOON


The Man in the Moon
Came tumbling down,
And asked his way to Norwich;

They told him south,
And he burnt his mouth
With eating cold pease-porridge.




TO MARKET, TO MARKET


To market, to market, to buy a fat Pig;
Home again, home again, dancing a jig.

To market, to market, to buy a fat Hog;
Home again, home again, jiggety-jog.




THERE WAS A MAN


There was a man, and he had nought,
  And robbers came to rob him;
He crept up to the chimney-pot,
  And then they thought they had him;
But he got down on t'other side,
  And then they could not find him;
He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days,
  And never looked behind him.




THE LION AND THE UNICORN


The Lion and the Unicorn
  Were fighting for the crown;
The Lion beat the unicorn
  All round about the town.

Some gave them white bread,
  And some gave them brown;
Some gave them plum-cake,
  And sent them out of town.




LITTLE MISS MUFFET


Little Miss Muffet
Sat on a tuffet
Eating of curds and whey;

  There came a big Spider
  And sat down beside her,
And frightened Miss Muffet away.




ORANGES AND LEMONS


_Gay go up, and gay go down
To ring the bells of London Town._

Bull's eyes and targets
Say the bells of St. Marg'ret's.

Brickbats and tiles,
Say the bells of St. Giles'.

Pancakes and fritters,
Say the bells of St. Peter's.

Two sticks and an apple,
Say the bells at Whitechapel.

Halfpence and farthings,
Say the bells of St. Martin's.

Oranges and Lemons,
Say the bells of St. Clement's.

Old Father Baldpate,
Say the slow bells at Aldgate.

Pokers and tongs,
Say the bells of St. John's.

Kettles and pans,
Say the bells of St. Ann's.

You owe me ten shillings,
Say the bells at St. Helen's.

When will you pay me?
Say the bells at Old Bailey.

When I grow rich,
Say the bells at Shoreditch.

Pray when will that be?
Say the bells of Stepney.

I am sure I don't know,
Says the great bell of Bow.

_Here comes a candle to light you to bed,
And here comes a chopper to chop off your head._




GOOSEY, GOOSEY GANDER


Goosey, Goosey Gander,
Where shall I wander?

Upstairs, downstairs,
And in my lady's chamber.

There I met an old man
  That would not say his prayers:
I took him by the left leg,
  And threw him downstairs.




HUMPTY DUMPTY


Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall;
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;

All the King's horses and all the King's men
Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty together again.




BAA, BAA, BLACK SHEEP


Baa, baa, Black Sheep,
  Have you any wool?
Yes, marry, have I,
  Three bags full:

One for my master,
  And one for my Dame,
And one for the little boy
  That lives in the lane!




THE THREE WISE MEN OF GOTHAM


Three wise men of Gotham
Went to sea in a bowl:

If the bowl had been stronger,
  My song would have been longer.




THIS LITTLE PIG WENT TO MARKET


This little pig went to market;
    This little pig stayed at home;
This little pig had roast beef;
    This little pig had none;
This little pig cried "Wee, wee, wee!
  I can't find my way
                     home!"




JACK AND JILL


Jack and Jill went up the hill
  To fetch a pail of water;
Jack fell down and broke his crown,
  And Jill came tumbling after.




SIMPLE SIMON


Simple Simon met a pieman,
  Going to the fair;

Says Simple Simon to the pieman,
  "Let me taste your ware."

Says the pieman to Simple Simon,
  "Do you mean to pay?"
Says Simon, "Yes, of course I do!"
And then he ran away.

Simple Simon went a-fishing
  For to catch a whale:
All the water he had got
  Was in his mother's pail.




THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN


There was a crooked man, and he went a crooked mile,
He found a crooked sixpence against a crooked stile:

He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse,
And they all lived together in a crooked little house.




LITTLE BO-PEEP

Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,
  And can't tell where to find them;
Leave them alone, and they'll come home,
  And bring their tails behind them.

Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,
  And dreamt she heard them bleating;
But when she awoke, she found it a joke,
  For they were still a-fleeting.

Then up she took her little crook,
  Determined for to find them;
She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
  For they'd left all their tails behind 'em.




RING O' ROSES


Ring a ring o' roses,
  A pocket full of posies;
Hush! hush! hush!
  And we all tumble down.




THERE WAS A LITTLE MAN


There was a little man,
And he had a little gun,
And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead;
He went to the brook
And saw a little duck,
And he shot it right through the head, head, head.

He carried it home
To his old wife Joan,
And bid her a fire for to make, make, make;
To roast the little duck
He had shot in the brook,
And he'd go and fetch her the drake, drake, drake.




GOOD KING ARTHUR


When good king Arthur ruled this land,
  He was a goodly king;
He stole three pecks of barley-meal,
  To make a bag-pudding.

A bag-pudding the king did make,
  And stuffed it well with plums;
And in it put great lumps of fat,
  As big as my two thumbs.

The king and queen did eat thereof,
  And noblemen beside;
And what they could not eat that night,
  The queen next morning fried.




HICKETY PICKETY MY BLACK HEN


Hickety, pickety, my black hen,
  She lays eggs for gentlemen;

Gentlemen come every day
To see what my black hen doth lay.




COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO


Cock-a-doodle-doo!
My dame has lost her shoe;
My master's lost his fiddling-stick,
And don't know what to do.

Cock-a-doodle-doo!
What is my dame to do?
Till master finds his fiddling-stick,
She'll dance without her shoe.

Cock-a-doodle-doo!
My dame has lost her shoe,
And master's found his fiddling-stick;
Sing doodle-doodle-doo!

Cock-a-doodle-doo!
My dame will dance with you,
While master fiddles his fiddling-stick,
For dame and doodle-doo.

Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Dame has lost her shoe;
Gone to bed and scratched her head,
And can't tell what to do.




WEE WILLIE WINKIE

Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town,
Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown,
Rapping at the window, crying through the lock,
"Are the children in their beds, for now it's eight o'clock?"

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
