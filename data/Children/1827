AN ENTERTAINING HISTORY OF TOM THUMB.


[Illustration]

    In great King Arthur's reign, Tom's history first begun;
    A farmer's wife had sigh'd in vain to have a darling son!
    A fairy listen'd to her call, and granted her the same;
    But being very small, Tom Thumb she did him name.

[Illustration]

    To please him every means she'd take,
    And a pudding large did for him make;
    But in trying to obtain a sip,
    Into the batter did he slip!
    The batter in the pot went plump;
    Tom made the pudding skip and jump!
    His mother, with affright, did this espy,
    And gave it to a tinker passing by;
    Tom scream'd so loud, that, in dismay,
    He threw it down, and ran away.

[Illustration]

    Tom to the fields with his mother went,
    To milk the cow was her intent;
    The wind blew high as they did walk,
    So she tied him to a thistle stalk;
    The cow the thistle view'd and cropp'd,
    In her mouth, with Tom, it soon was popp'd!
    Her teeth put Tom in such a fright,
    That he "mother" bawl'd with all his might!
    The cow, on hearing such a rout,
    Open'd her jaws, and Tom step'd out.

[Illustration]

    Our hero great exploits went through;
    Away with him, once, a raven flew!
    A giant on him made a dish;
    He once was swallow'd by a fish!
    Poor Tom fell sick; when, in a trice,
    There came a car with flying mice:
    The queen, inside the car so grand,
    Convey'd poor Tom to a fairy land.
    His health restored, she, by her art,
    In a gale, sent Tom to Arthur's court.

[Illustration]

    King Arthur loved good furmenty,--
    The cook made a bowl for his majesty;
    In conveying it to the palace, hot,
    Our hero into the bowl did drop!
    The cook was fill'd with great surprise,
    For the liquor burnt his nose and eyes.
    The bowl being broke, the angry cook
    Before the king our hero took:
    When the king beheld Tom's awful plight,
    He pardon gave, and dubb'd him knight.

[Illustration]

    Tom, in the palace, lived content;
    With the king to hunt, on a mouse he went:
    One day, the mouse a cat espied,
    And soon to catch him pussey tried;
    Tom drew his sword, and spoilt her treat,
    By slaying pussey at his feet.
    Thus, Tom lived happy--without strife,
    Till the queen, in anger, sought his life.
    In the palace he could no longer stay;
    So on a butterfly he rode away.

[Illustration]

    The butterfly flew from flower to flower;
    The queen tried to catch it for many an hour;
    Till at last, oh, direful tale to tell,
    Into a spider's web our hero fell!
    The spider ran to seize his prey;
    Tom, with his sword, fought valiantly;
    Till, alas! the spider's poisonous breath
    Was the cause of our gallant hero's death.
    In a bower of roses his tomb they rear'd,
    And on it this epitaph appear'd:--

[Illustration]

    Of life deprived, by a spider's bite,
    Here lies Tom Thumb, a valiant knight:
    His feasts in Arthur's court, and sight,
    Fill'd all with wonder and delight.
    He was bold at tilt and tournament;
    On a mouse, with the king, the hunt he went:
    His deeds were great, tho' his size was small,
    And his death was mourned by one and all.
    Then, reader, pause; one tear now shed,
    And cry, "Alas! Tom Thumb is dead."

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
