THE BABES
IN THE WOOD

[Illustration: SORE SICKE THEY WERE AND LIKE TO DYE]




The BABES IN THE WOOD.


[Illustration]

    Now ponder well, you parents deare,
      These wordes which I shall write;
    A doleful story you shall heare,
      In time brought forth to light.

    A gentleman of good account
      In Norfolke dwelt of late.
    Who did in honour far surmount
      Most men of his estate.

    Sore sicke he was, and like to dye,
      No helpe his life could save;
    His wife by him as sicke did lye,
      And both possest one grave.

[Illustration]

    No love between these two was lost,
      Each was to other kinde;
    In love they liv'd, in love they dyed,
      And left two babes behinde:

    The one a fine and pretty boy,
      Not passing three yeares olde;
    The other a girl more young than he
      And fram'd in beautye's molde.

    The father left his little son,
      As plainlye doth appeare,
    When he to perfect age should come
      Three hundred poundes a yeare.

    And to his little daughter Jane
      Five hundred poundes in gold,
    To be paid downe on marriage-day,
      Which might not be controll'd:

[Illustration]

    But if the children chanced to dye,
      Ere they to age should come,
    Their uncle should possesse their wealth;
      For so the wille did run.

[Illustration: NOW, BROTHER, said the dying man, LOOK TO MY CHILDREN
DEARE.]

    "Now, brother," said the dying man,
      "Look to my children deare;
    Be good unto my boy and girl,
      No friendes else have they here:

    "To God and you I do commend
      My children deare this daye;
    But little while be sure we have
      Within this world to staye.

    "You must be father and mother both,
      And uncle all in one;
    God knowes what will become of them,
      When I am dead and gone."

[Illustration]

    With that bespake their mother deare:
      "O brother kinde," quoth shee,
    You are the man must bring our babes
      To wealth or miserie:

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "And if you keep them carefully,
      Then God will you reward;
    But if you otherwise should deal,
      God will your deedes regard."

[Illustration: WITH LIPPES AS COLD AS ANY STONE, THEY KIST THE CHILDREN
SMALL]

    With lippes as cold as any stone.
      They kist the children small:
    'God bless you both, my children deare;'
      With that the teares did fall.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    These speeches then their brother spake
      To this sicke couple there:
    "The keeping of your little ones,
      Sweet sister, do not feare:

    "God never prosper me nor mine,
      Nor aught else that I have,
    If I do wrong your children deare,
      When you are layd in grave."

[Illustration]

[Illustration: THEIR PARENTS BEING DEAD & GONE, THE CHILDREN HOME HE
TAKES.]

    The parents being dead and gone,
      The children home he takes,
    And bringes them straite unto his house,
      Where much of them he makes.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    He had not kept these pretty babes
      A twelvemonth and a daye,
    But, for their wealth, he did devise
      To make them both awaye.

    He bargain'd with two ruffians strong,
      Which were of furious mood,
    That they should take the children young,
      And slaye them in a wood.

[Illustration]

    He told his wife an artful tale,
      He would the children send
    To be brought up in faire London,
      With one that was his friend.

[Illustration]

    Away then went those pretty babes,
      Rejoycing at that tide,
    Rejoycing with a merry minde,
      They should on cock-horse ride.

[Illustration: AWAY THEN WENT THE PRETTY BABES REJOYCING AT THAT TIDE]

[Illustration]

    They prate and prattle pleasantly
      As they rode on the waye,
    To those that should their butchers be,
      And work their lives' decaye:

    So that the pretty speeche they had,
      Made murderers' heart relent:
    And they that undertooke the deed,
      Full sore did now repent.

    Yet one of them, more hard of heart,
      Did vow to do his charge,
    Because the wretch, that hired him,
      Had paid him very large.

[Illustration]

    The other would not agree thereto,
      So here they fell to strife;
    With one another they did fight,
      About the children's life:

[Illustration]

    And he that was of mildest mood,
      Did slaye the other there,
    Within an unfrequented wood,
      Where babes did quake for feare!

[Illustration: AND HE THAT WAS OF MILDEST MOOD DID SLAYE THE OTHER
THERE]

[Illustration]

    He took the children by the hand,
      While teares stood in their eye,
    And bade them come and go with him,
      And look they did not crye:

    And two long miles he ledd them on,
      While they for food complaine:
    "Stay here," quoth he, "I'll bring ye bread,
      When I come back againe."

[Illustration]

    These prettye babes, with hand in hand,
      Went wandering up and downe;

[Illustration]

    But never more they sawe the man
    Approaching from the town.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Their prettye lippes with blackberries
      Were all besmear'd and dyed;
    And when they sawe the darksome night,
      They sat them downe and cryed.

[Illustration]

    Thus wandered these two prettye babes,
      Till death did end their grief;
    In one another's armes they dyed,
      As babes wanting relief.

    No burial these prettye babes
      Of any man receives,

[Illustration]

    Till Robin-redbreast painfully
      Did cover them with leaves.

[Illustration: IN ONE ANOTHER'S ARMS THEY DYED.]

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
