  You little girl,
  You little boy,
  With wondering eyes,
  That kindly look,
  In honour of
  Two noble names
  I send the offering
  Of this book.

SUSAN BLUE.


              Oh, Susan Blue,
              How do you do?
      Please may I go for a walk with you?
              Where shall we go?
              Oh, I know--
  Down in the meadow where the cowslips grow!

       =================================

[Illustration]




BLUE SHOES.


  Little Blue Shoes
  Mustn't go
  Very far alone, you know
  Else she'll fall down,
  Or, lose her way;
  Fancy--what
  Would mamma say?
  Better put her little hand
  Under sister's wise command.
  When she's a little older grown
  Blue Shoes may go quite alone.

       =================================

[Illustration]




STREET SHOW.


  Puff, puff, puff. How the trumpets blow
  All you little boys and girls come and see the show.
  One--two--three, the Cat runs up the tree;
  But the little Bird he flies away--
  "She hasn't got me!"

       =================================

[Illustration]




TO THE SUN DOOR.


  They saw it rise in the morning,
    They saw it set at night,
  And they longed to go and see it,
    Ah! if they only might.

  The little soft white clouds heard them,
    And stepped from out of the blue;
  And each laid a little child softly
    Upon its bosom of dew.

  And they carried them higher and higher,
    And they nothing knew any more
  Until they were standing waiting
    In front of the round gold door.

  And they knocked, and called, and entreated,
    Whoever should be within;
  But all to no purpose, for no one
    Would hearken to let them in.

       =================================

[Illustration]




THE DAISIES.


  You very fine Miss Molly,
    What will the daisies say,
  If you carry home so many
    Of their little friends to-day?

  Perhaps you take a sister,
    Perhaps you take a brother,
  Or two little daisies who
    Were fond of one another.

       =================================

THE DANCING FAMILY.


  Pray let me introduce you to
    This little dancing family;
  For morning, afternoon, and night
    They danced away so happily.

  They twirled round about,
    They turned their toes out;
  The people wondered what the noise
    Could all be about.

  They danced from early morning,
    Till very late at night;
  Both in-doors and out-of-doors,
    With very great delight.

  And every sort of dance they knew,
    From every country far away;
  And so it was no wonder that
    They should keep dancing all the day.

  So dancing--dancing--dancing,
    In sunshine or in rain;
  And when they all left off,
    Why then--they all began again.

GOING TO SEE GRANDMAMMA.


  Little Molly and Damon
    Are walking so far,
  For they're going to see
    Their kind Grandmamma.

  And they very well know,
    When they get there she'll take
  From out of her cupboard
    Some very nice cake.

  And into her garden
    They know they may run,
  And pick some red currants,
    And have lots of fun.

  So Damon to doggie
    Says, "How do you do?"
  And asks his mamma
    If he may not go too.

       =================================

[Illustration]




WISHES.


  Oh, if you were a little boy,
    And I was a little girl--
  Why you would have some whiskers grow
    And then my hair would curl.

  Ah! if I could have whiskers grow,
    I'd let you have my curls;
  But what's the use of wishing it--
    Boys never can be girls.

       =================================

[Illustration]




FIRST ARRIVALS.


  It is a Party, do you know,
  And there they sit, all in a row,
  Waiting till the others come,
  To begin to have some fun.

  Hark! the bell rings sharp and clear,
  Other little friends appear;
  And no longer all alone
  They begin to feel at home.

  To them a little hard is Fate,
  Yet better early than too late;
  Fancy getting there forlorn,
  With the tea and cake all gone.

  Wonder what they'll have for tea;
  Hope the jam is strawberry.
  Wonder what the dance and game;
  Feel so very glad they came.

  Very Happy may you be,
  May you much enjoy your tea.

       =================================

WHEN WE WENT OUT WITH GRANDMAMMA.


  When we went out with Grandmamma--
    Mamma said for a treat--
  Oh, dear, how stiff we had to walk
    As we went down the street.

  One on each side we had to go,
    And never laugh or loll;
  I carried Prim, her Spaniard dog,
    And Tom--her parasol.

[Illustration]

  If _I_ looked right--_if Tom_ looked left--
    "Tom--Susan--I'm ashamed;
  And little Prim, I'm sure, is shocked,
    To hear such naughties named."

  She said we had no manners,
    If we ever talked or sung;
  "You should have seen," said Grandmamma,
    "_Me_ walk, when _I_ was young."

  She told us--oh, so often--
    How little girls and boys,
  In the good days when she was young,
    Never made any noise.

  She said they never wished then
    To play--oh, indeed!
  They learnt to sew and needlework,
    Or else to write and read.

  She said her mother never let
    Her speak a word at meals;
  "But now," said Grandmamma, "you'd think
    That children's tongues had wheels

  "So fast they go--clack, clack, clack, clack;
    Now listen well, I pray,
  And let me see you both improve
    From what I've said to-day."

       =================================

[Illustration]




TO MYSTERY LAND.


  Oh, dear, how will it end?
  Peggy and Susie how naughty you are.
  You little know where you are,
  Going so far, and so high,
  Nearly up to the sky.
  Perhaps it's a Giant who lives there,
  And perhaps it's a lovely Princess.
  But you very well know
  You've no business to go;
  You'll get yourselves into a mess.

  Oh, dear, I'm sure it is true;
  Whatever on earth can it matter to you?
  For you know it--oh, fie--
  That it's naughty to pry
  Into other's affairs--
  Into other folks houses to go,
  Where you know
  You're not asked.
  So you'd better come back
  While there's time, it is plain.
  Go home--and be never
  So naughty again.

       =================================

[Illustration]

[Illustration]




FROM MARKET.


      Oh who'll give us Posies,
      And Garlands of Roses,
      To twine round our heads so gay?
      For here we come bringing
      You many good wishes to-day.
  From market--from market--from market--
      We all come up from market.

[Illustration]

       =================================

LITTLE PHILLIS.


  I am a very little girl,
    I think that I've turned two;
  And if you'd like to know my name
    I'd like to tell it you.

  They always call me Baby,
    But Phillis is my name.
  No--no one ever gave it me,
    I think it only came.

  I've got a pretty tulip
    In my little flower-bed;
  If you would like I'll give it you--
    It's yellow, striped with red.

  I've got a little kitten, but
    I can't give that away,
  She likes to play with me _so_ much;
    She's gone to sleep to-day.

  And I've got a nice new dolly,
    Shall I fetch her out to you?
  She's got such pretty shoes on,
    And her bonnet's trimmed with blue.

  You'd like to take her home with you?
    Oh, _no_, she mustn't go;
  Good-bye--I want to run now,
    You walk along so slow.

       =================================

[Illustration]




THE FOUR PRINCESSES.


  Four Princesses lived in a Green Tower--
    A Bright Green Tower in the middle of the sea;
  And no one could think--oh, no one could think--
    Who the Four Princesses could be.

  One looked to the North, and one to the South,
    And one to the East, and one to the West;
  They were all so pretty, so very pretty,
    You could not tell which was the prettiest.

  Their curls were golden--their eyes were blue,
    And their voices were sweet as a silvery bell;
  And four white birds around them flew,
    But where they came from--_who_ could tell?

  Oh, who could tell? for no one knew,
    And not a word could you hear them say.
  But the sound of their singing, like church bells ringing,
    Would sweetly float as they passed away.

  For under the sun, and under the stars,
    They often sailed on the distant sea;
  Then in their Green Tower and Roses bower
    They lived again--a mystery.

[Illustration]

       =================================

[Illustration]




WHEN YOU AND I GROW UP.


  When you and I
  Grow up--Polly--
    I mean that you and me,
  Shall go sailing in a big ship
    Right over all the sea.
  We'll wait till we are older,
    For if we went to-day,
  You know that we might lose ourselves,
    And never find the way.

[Illustration]

       =================================

IN AN APPLE TREE.


  In September, when the apples were red,
  To Belinda I said,
  "Would you like to go away
  To Heaven, or stay
  Here in this orchard full of trees
  All your life?" And she said, "If you please
  I'll stay here--where I know,
  And the flowers grow."

       =================================

[Illustration]




THE WEDDING BELLS.


  The Wedding Bells were ringing,
    And Monday was the day,
  And all the little ladies
    Were there so fresh and gay.

  And up--up--up the steps they went,
    The wedding fine to see;
  And the Roses were all for the Bride,
    So pretty--so pretty was she.

[Illustration]

       =================================

[Illustration]




THE LITTLE LONDON GIRL.


  In my little Green House, quite content am I,
  When the hot sun pours down from the sky;
  For oh, I love the country--the beautiful country.
  Who'd live in a London street when there's the country?

  I live in a London street, then I long and long
  To be the whole day the sweet Flowers among
  Instead of tall chimney-pots up in the sky,
  The joy of seeing Birds and Dragon Flies go by.

  At home I lie in bed, and cannot go to sleep,
  For the sound of cart-wheels upon the hard street.
  But here my eyes close up to no sound of anything
  Except it is to hear the nightingales sing.

  And then I see the Chickens and the Geese go walking,
  I hear the Pigs and the Ducks all talking.
  And the Red and the Spotted Cows they stare at me,
  As if they wondered whoever I could be.

  I see the little Lambs out with their mothers--
  Such pretty little white young sisters and brothers.
  Oh, I'll stay in the country, and make a daisy chain,
  And never go back to London again.

[Illustration]

       =================================

[Illustration]




TO BABY.


  Oh, what shall my blue eyes go see?
    Shall it be pretty Quack-Quack to-day?
  Or the Peacock upon the Yew Tree?
    Or the dear little white Lambs at play?
            Say Baby.
  For Baby is such a young Petsy,
    And Baby is such a sweet Dear.
  And Baby is growing quite old now--
    She's just getting on for a year.

       =================================

[Illustration]




WILLY AND HIS SISTER.


  Willy said to his sister,
    "Please may I go with you?"
  She said, "You must behave
    Very nicely if you do."

  "Please will you take me then
    To look at the mill?"
  "Yes," she said, "because you are
    So very good--I will."

  "The miller he is
    So very white and kind;
  And sprinkled all over
    With the flour they grind.

  "And the big heaps of corn
    That lie upon the floor;
  He will let me play with those
    I am quite sure.

  "I like to hear the wheel
    Make such a rushing sound,
  And see the pretty water
    Go round, and round, and round.

  "So take me to the mill,
    For then you shall see
  What a very, very good boy
    I really mean to be."

[Illustration]

       =================================

AT SCHOOL.


  Five little Girls, sitting on a form,
  Five little Girls, with lessons to learn,
  Five little Girls, who, I'm afraid,
  Won't know them a bit when they have to be said.

  For little eyes are given to look
  Anywhere else than on their book;
  And little thoughts are given to stray
  Anywhere--ever so far away.

       =================================

[Illustration]




HAPPY DAYS.


  "Are you going next week to see Phillis and Phoebe?
    Phillis on Monday will be just fourteen.
  She says we shall all have our tea in the garden,
    And afterwards have some nice games on the green.

  "I wanted a new frock, but mother said, 'No,'
    So I must be content with my old one you see.
  But then white is so pretty, and kind Aunt Matilda
    Has sent down a beautiful necklace for me."

[Illustration]

  "Oh, yes, I am going, and Peggy is going,
    And mother is making us new frocks to wear;
  I shall have my red sash and my hat with pink ribbons--
    I know all the girls will be smart who are there.

  "And then, too, we're going to each take a nosegay--
    The larger the better--for Phillis to say
  That all her friends love her, and wish her so happy,
    And bring her sweet flowers upon her birthday.

  "And won't it be lovely, in beautiful sunshine,
    The table spread under the great apple tree,
  To see little Phillis--that dear little Phillis--
    Look smiling all round as she pours out the tea!"

       =================================

[Illustration]




THE LITTLE QUEEN'S COMING.


      With Roses--red Roses,
      We'll pelt her with Roses,
  And Lilies--white Lilies we'll drop at her feet;
      The little Queen's coming,
      The people are running--
  The people are running to greet and to meet.

      Then clash out a welcome,
      Let all the bells sound, come,
  To give her a welcoming proud and sweet.
      How her blue eyes will beam,
      And her golden curls gleam,
  When the sound of our singing rings down the street.

       =================================

[Illustration]




ON THE WALL TOP.


  Dancing and prancing to town we go,
  On the top of the wall of the town we go.
  Shall we talk to the stars, or talk to the moon,
  Or run along home to our dinner so soon?

       =================================

[Illustration]




ON THE WALL TOP.


  So high--so high on the wall we run,
  The nearer the sky--why, the nearer the sun,
  If you give me one penny, I'll give you two,
  For that's the way good neighbours do.

       =================================

[Illustration]




TIP-A-TOE.


  Tip-a-Toe,
  See them go;
  One, two, three--
  Chloe, Prue, and me;
  Up and down,
  To the town.
  A Lord was there,
  And the Lady fair.
  And what did they sing?
  Oh, "Ring-a-ding-ding;"
  And the Black Crow flew off
  With the Lady's Ring.

       =================================

[Illustration]




MAMMAS AND BABIES.


  "My Polly is so very good,
    Belinda never cries;
  My Baby often goes to sleep,
    See how she shuts her eyes.

  "Dear Mrs. Lemon tell me when
    Belinda goes to school;
  And what time does she go to bed?"
    "Well, eight o'clock's the rule.

  "But now and then, just for a treat,
    I let her wait awhile;
  You shake your head--why, wouldn't you?
    Do look at Baby's smile!"

[Illustration]

  "Dear Mrs. Primrose will you come
    One day next week to tea?
  Of course bring Rosalinda, and
    That darling--Rosalie."

  "Dear Mrs. Cowslip, you _are_ kind;
    My little folks, I know,
  Will be so very pleased to come;
    Dears--tell Mrs. Cowslip so.

  "Oh, do you know--perhaps you've not heard--
    She had a dreadful fright;
  My Daisy with the measles
    Kept me up every night.

  "And then I've been so worried--
    Clarissa had a fit;
  And the doctor said he couldn't
    In the least account for it."

[Illustration]

       =================================

[Illustration]




MY LITTLE GIRLIE.


  Little girlie tell to me
  What your wistful blue eyes see?
  Why you like to stand so high,
  Looking at the far off sky.

  Does a tiny Fairy flit
  In the pretty blue of it?
  Or is it that you hope so soon
  To see the rising yellow Moon?

  Or is it--as I think I've heard--
  You're looking for a little Bird
  To come and sit upon a spray,
  And sing the summer night away?

       =================================

[Illustration]




THE CATS HAVE COME TO TEA.


  What did she see--oh, what did she see,
  As she stood leaning against the tree?
  Why all the Cats had come to tea.

  What a fine turn out--from round about,
  All the houses had let them out,
  And here they were with scamper and shout.

  "Mew--mew--mew!" was all they could say,
  And, "We hope we find you well to-day."

  Oh, what should she do--oh, what should she do?
  What a lot of milk they would get through;
  For here they were with "Mew--mew--mew!"

  She didn't know--oh, she didn't know,
  If bread and butter they'd like or no;
  They might want little mice, oh! oh! oh!

  Dear me--oh, dear me,
  All the cats had come to tea.

       =================================

[Illustration]




THE TEA PARTY.


  In the pleasant green Garden
    We sat down to tea;
  "Do you take sugar?" and
    "Do you take milk?"
  She'd got a new gown on--
    A smart one of silk.
  We all were so happy
    As happy could be,
  On that bright Summer's day
    When she asked us to tea.

[Illustration]

       =================================

[Illustration]




UNDER ROSE ARCHES.


  Under Rose Arches to Rose Town--
    Rose Town on the top of the hill;
  For the Summer wind blows and music goes,
    And the violins sound shrill.

  Twist and twine Roses and Lilies,
    And little leaves green,
    Fit for a queen;
  Twist and twine Roses and Lilies.

  Oh, Roses shall be for her carpet,
    And her curtains of Roses so fair;
  And a Rosy crown, while far adown
    Floats her long golden hair.

  Twist and twine Roses and Lilies,
    And all the bells ring,
    And all the people sing;
  Twist and twine Roses and Lilies.

       =================================

[Illustration]




A GENTEEL FAMILY.


  Some children are so naughty,
    And some are very good;
  But the Genteel Family
    Did always what it should.

  They put on gloves when they went out,
    And ran not in the street;
  And on wet days not one of them
    Had ever muddy feet.

  Then they were always so polite,
    And always thanked you so;
  And never threw their toys about,
    As naughty children do.

  They always learnt their lessons
    When it was time they should;
  And liked to eat up all their crusts--
    They were so very good.

  And then their frocks were never torn,
    Their tuckers always clean;
  And their hair so very tidy--
    Always quite fit to be seen.

  Then they made calls with their mamma
    And were so very neat;
  And learnt to bow becomingly
    When they met you in the street.

  And really they were everything
    That children ought to be;
  And well may be examples now
    For little you--and me.

[Illustration]

       =================================

BABY MINE.


  Baby mine, over the trees;
    Baby mine, over the flowers;
  Baby mine, over the sunshine;
    Baby mine, over the showers.

  Baby mine, over the land;
    Baby mine, over the water.
  Oh, when had a mother before
    Such a sweet--such a sweet, little daughter!

       =================================

[Illustration]




LITTLE GIRLS AND LITTLE LAMBS.


  In the May-time flowers grow;
  Little girls in meadows go;
  Little lambs frisk with delight,
  And in the green grass sleep at night.
  Little birds sing all the day,
  Oh, in such a happy way!
  All the day the sun is bright,
  Little stars shine all the night.
  The Cowslip says to the Primrose,
  "How soft the little Spring wind blows!"
  The Daisy and the Buttercup
  Sing every time that they look up.
  For beneath the sweet blue sky
  They see a pretty Butterfly;
  The Butterfly, when he looks down,
  Says, "What a pretty Flower Town!"

[Illustration]

       =================================

[Illustration]




FROM WONDER WORLD.


  Out of Wonder World I think you come;
  For in your eyes the wonder comes with you.
  The stars are the windows of Heaven,
  And sometimes I think you peep through.
  Oh, little girl, tell us do the Flowers
  Tell you secrets when they find you all alone?
  Or the Birds and Butterflies whisper
  Of things to us unknown?

  Or do angel voices speak to you so softly,
  When _we_ only hear a little wind sigh;
  And the peaceful dew of Heaven fall upon you
  When _we_ only see a white cloud passing by?

[Illustration]

       =================================

[Illustration]




CHILD'S SONG.


  The King and the Queen were riding
    Upon a Summer's day,
  And a Blackbird flew above them,
    To hear what they did say.

  The King said he liked apples,
    The Queen said she liked pears.
  And what shall we do to the Blackbird
    Who listens unawares.

       =================================

[Illustration]




MISS MOLLY AND THE LITTLE FISHES.


  Oh, sweet Miss Molly,
  You're so fond
  Of Fishes in a little Pond.
  And perhaps they're glad
  To see you stare
  With such bright eyes
  Upon them there.
  And when your fingers and your thumbs
  Drop slowly in the small white crumbs
  I hope they're happy. Only this--
  When you've looked long enough, sweet miss.
  Then, most beneficent young giver,
  Restore them to their native river.

       =================================




THE LITTLE JUMPING GIRLS.


[Illustration]

  Jump--jump--jump--
    Jump away
  From this town into
    The next, to-day.

  Jump--jump--jump--
    Jump over the moon;
  Jump all the morning,
    And all the noon.

  Jump--jump--jump--
    Jump all night;
  Won't our mothers
    Be in a fright?

  Jump--jump--jump--
    Over the sea;
  What wonderful wonders
    We shall see.

  Jump--jump--jump--
    And leave behind
  Everything evil
    That we may find.

  Jump--jump--jump--
    Jump far away;
  And all come home
    Some other day.

       =================================




RING-A-RING.


  Ring-a-ring of little boys.
    Ring-a-ring of girls;
  All around--all around,
    Twists and twirls.

[Illustration]

  You are merry children;
    "Yes, we are."
  Where do you come from?
    "Not very far.

  "We live in the mountain,
    We live in the tree;
  And I live in the river-bed,
    And you won't catch me!"

       =================================

[Illustration]




ON THE BRIDGE.


  If I could see a little fish--
  That is what I just now wish!
  I want to see his great round eyes
  Always open in surprise.

  I wish a water rat would glide
  Slowly to the other side;
  Or a dancing spider sit
  On the yellow flags a bit.

  I think I'll get some stones to throw,
  And watch the pretty circles show.
  Or shall we sail a flower-boat,
  And watch it slowly--slowly float?

  That's nice--because you never know
  How far away it means to go;
  And when to-morrow comes, you see,
  It may be in the great wide sea.

       =================================

[Illustration]




BALL.


  One--two, is one to you:
  One--two--three, is one to me.
  Throw it fast or not at all,
  And mind you do not let it fall.

  Fairy Blue Eyes
    And Fairy Brown,
  And dear little Golden Curls,
    Look down.
  I say "Good-bye"--
    "Good-bye" with no pain--
  Till some happy day

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
