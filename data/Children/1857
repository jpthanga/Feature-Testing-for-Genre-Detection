THE
TINY
PICTURE BOOK.

[Illustration]

G. W. HOBBS, CHARLESTOWN.




[Illustration]

APPLES so round, and bright, and red--
  O, how I love to see;
They look so tempting as they hang
  Upon the green old tree.

A naughty boy once tried to steal
  From off his neighbor's bough;
But sad to hear, adown he fell,
  And is a cripple now.


[Illustration]

BOYS oftentimes are rough and rude,
  And join in wicked play;
But hoop and top, and bat and ball,
  Are better any day.

"Hark! hark! I hear a tinkling bell;
  It calleth me to school."
Run, run! my boy, and study well;
  Keep strictly every rule.


[Illustration]

CAREFUL be of poor old puss,
  She catcheth all the mice:
If any rat appears in sight,
  She chases in a trice.

And then she comes and sits her down,
  And washes all her fur;
How kind and loving doth she look--
  How pleasant doth she purr.


[Illustration]

DOGS are so faithful, kind, and true,
  We ought to treat them well;
My little Johnny had a dog,
  Of which I wish to tell.

Now little John was at his play
  Beside the river's brink--
Plash! in he fell! Good Rover ran,
  And would not let him sink.


[Illustration]

EGGS are most useful to mamma;
  She says she could not make,
Without the help of new-laid eggs,
  Good pudding or nice cake.

I'm sure the hens are very kind
  To lay for us some eggs;
O, do not stone or tease them so,
  You'll break their little legs.


[Illustration]

FROGS! frogs! I hear their merry croak
  From river, pond, and stream;
O, now I know that Spring has come,
  And all will soon be green.

Who would not sing in sweet spring-time,
  The time of song and flowers?
Dear children, youth is your spring-time;
  Improve its precious hours.


[Illustration]

GIRLS should be gentle, soft, and mild;
  Never be rough and rude;
It always makes a happy home,
  Where little girls are good.

And they should love sweet Jesus, too;
  His blessed laws obey;
At morning's light, at evening's shade,
  For his kind blessing pray.


[Illustration]

HIVES are the homes of little bees,
  And when the day is fair,
In busy haste they sally forth
  Into the sunny air,

To gather honey from the flowers,
  And bear it to the hive.
Buzz--buzz--work--work--the livelong day;
  O, how the busy thrive!


[Illustration]

"IBEX! what is an Ibex, pa?"
  Said little John, one day;
"A strange and funny animal,
  Where do they live, I pray?"

"It is a kind of goat, my son,
  Whose horns are wondrous long,
They climb the rough and snowy Alps,
  With nimble feet and strong."


[Illustration]

JUGS that we use are chiefly made
  Of stone or earthen ware;
We find them very useful, and
  Must handle them with care.

But jugs are sometimes used by men,
  To hold their rum or gin--
These are temptations, children dear;
  Pray to be kept from sin.


[Illustration]

KEGS, too, so useful in their way,
  Are tightly made of wood;
We pack our butter and our lard
  In kegs to keep them good.

Their form is homely--but if clean,
  They very useful are;
The meanest household article,
  Requires the nicest care.


[Illustration]

LAMB--pretty, little, quiet lamb,
  So gentle and so mild;
O, do not be afraid of me,
  I'm but a little child.

O, may I be of that dear flock,
  Of which the Saviour told;
Within the pastures of his love,
  He keeps his precious fold.


[Illustration]

MELONS do in the garden grow,
  And very fine are they;
Cool and refreshing to the taste,
  Upon a summer's day.

And melons grow upon a vine
  That creepeth on the ground;
Amidst the green and silky leaves,
  The rich, ripe fruit is found.


[Illustration]

NEST! O, a little robin's nest!
  Up in the apple tree!
Four little eggs all blue and white,
  So close and snug, I see.

"Mother, how could a little bird
  So neat a nest have made?"
"'Twas God that taught the little bird
  How every straw was laid."


[Illustration]

"O, how I hate an ugly owl!"
  Cried little Johnny Lee;
This is a very silly hate,
  In Johnny's heart to be.

Our God did make the hooting owl,
  For purpose good and wise;
O, there is nothing we should hate,
  But sin's unholy guise.


[Illustration]

PIGS we are apt to treat with scorn,
  But this is hardly fair.
For very useful is poor pig.
  You surely will declare.

He helps to form our sausages,
  And they are very good;
His bristles make our brushes, and
  His pork we love for food.


[Illustration]

QUAILS fill my mind with holy thoughts;
  For when the chosen tribe
Were wandering in the wilderness
  Jehovah was their guide.

When hungry, to the Lord they cried;
  He sent them quails for food.
God will send us, in hour of need,
  Whatever is for good.


[Illustration]

ROSES are very fair to see,
  And fragrant is their breath;
Their soft perfume doth scent the air
  The sweetest after death.

O, let us die in holy peace;
  And may our deeds of love
Bear witness of a holy life,
  A pledge of rest above.


[Illustration]

SWANS float upon the waters blue;
  How beautiful the sight!
Their snowy plumage, graceful form,
  And neck so arched and light!

Old poets say, the swan doth sing
  One song with dying breath;
How sweet the thought--with holy song
  To welcome coming death!


[Illustration]

TIGERS are handsome, noble beasts,
  But O, most fierce are they!
With mighty strength and bloody grasp,
  They pounce upon their prey.

So beauty is of little worth,
  Without a gentle mind;
Though few are handsome, yet we all
  Can gentle be, and kind.


[Illustration]

URNS were much used in olden time;
  The bodies of the dead
Were burnt to ashes, and the dust
  In urns deposited.

And often, on the tombstones now,
  We see carved out an urn,
To tell us all we are but dust,
  To which we must return.


[Illustration]

VINES form a cool, refreshing shade,
  And grapes are fine and fair,
Hanging in purple clusters--O,
  They look so rich and rare!

Our Saviour saith, "I am a vine,
  My branches shall ye be;
I will abide with you in love,
  If ye abide in me."


[Illustration]

WOLVES are both fierce and cruel beasts,
  And feed on little lambs,
If they perchance do stray away
  From the kind shepherd's hands.

We are the lambs of Jesus' fold;
  O, may we never stray
From our good Shepherd, lest we lose
  The straight and narrow way.


[Illustration]

XEBECS are ships with three small masts,
  And light and fast they sail,
But cannot stand a boisterous storm,
  Or weather a rude gale.

This life is like a wide-spread sea;
  And, guided by the hand
Of Him who made us, we sail on
  To reach a heavenly land.


[Illustration]

YACHTS are small pleasure boats, both light
  And airy in their form;
They float upon a summer sea,
  But anchor in a storm.

Our anchor is the hope of heaven;
  When storms of sorrow lower,
Secure and firm, we will not fear,
  Even in the darkest hour.


[Illustration]

ZEBRAS in form are like our horse,
  Though not so tall and slim;
Striped and glossy, smooth and bright,
  And beautiful their skin.

They are not docile, like the horse,
  They treat man with disdain;
They spurn the rider and his whip,
  His bridle, bit and rein.


[Illustration]


[Illustration]

"Why must I learn my A, B, C?"
Asked little Kate; "it wearies me.
I wish to put my book away,
I wish to run about and play.
There's kitty in the portico,
O dear! if I could only go;
Indeed, I think it very wrong
To make poor kitty wait so long;
I'll gather pretty flowers for you,
If I may go--do let me, do."


RUN AND PLAY.

Now run away, you little things,
  And romp, and jump, and play;
You have been quiet long enough,
  So run away, I say.

Fred, you and Lucy roll your hoops;
  You on a stick can ride;
And nurse, with baby, run a race,
  Or any play beside.

Little boys and girls may romp,
  And frisk, and jump, and play;
Book and lessons both are done:
  So run away, I say.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
