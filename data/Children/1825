THE EMPEROR'S ROUT.


  As the _Emperor Moth_[1] sat one evening in May,
  Fanned by numberless wings in the moon's silver ray,
  While around him the zephyrs breathed sweetest perfume,
  Thus he spoke to his dwarf with the _Ragged white plume_:[2]
  "That vain Butterfly's Ball, I hear, was most splendid,
  And, as the world says, very fully attended,
  Though she never asked us, but assigned as a cause,
  We were all much too heavy to gallope and waltz.
  What impertinence this, want of grace to ascribe
  To the Lord of the whole Lepidopterous tribe;
  I too'll give a ball, and such folks to chastise,
  I'll not be at home to these pert butterflies.
  Bid the _Empress_[3] come hither, and we'll talk about
  What arrangements to make for a capital rout."

[Illustration: THE INVITATION.]

  The Empress obeyed her lord's summons with speed,
  And proceeded her visiting tablets to read,
  That those of her subjects, whose homage was booked
  In that coveted record, might not be o'erlooked.
  Then the _Bufftip_[4] began to write each moth a card,
  Having one for herself just by way of reward.
  "First ask," says the Emperor, "the _Glory of Kent_,[5]
  On having much beauty my mind is quite bent;
  The _Belle_, too, _of Brixton_,[6] the _Marvel du Jour_,[7]
  And the _Peach-blossom_[8] moth you'll invite, I am sure;
  The _Sphinx_[9] too, shall come, who makes riddles so well,
  And the _Gipsey_[10] be ready our fortunes to tell;
  _Mother Shipton_[11] shall chap'rone the lovely _Black I_,[12]
  And those awkward Greek girls, _Lambda_,[13] _Gamma_,[14]
        and _Chi_;[15]
  _Hebrew Character_,[16] too, who for routs has a passion;
  And I'll ask Mrs. _Gothic_,[17] though she's out of fashion,
  For I love my old friends, and had rather that they
  Should partake of our feast, than the idle and gay,
  Who flutter about without object or reason,
  Just live for an hour, and last but a season."
  How little, alas! do great moths bear in mind,
  That their tenure of life is of just the same kind.
  "You're right," said the Empress, "and truly 'twere shabby,
  T'exclude from our party poor old Mrs. _Tabby_,[18]
  And the _Rustics_[19] I'll ask, though not one has a gown
  In which to appear, save of black, grey, or brown;
  And some of them go, too, so feathered and flounced,
  That the _Coxcomb_[20] called _Prominent_, on them pronounced
  A sentence of censure, quite just, but so tart,
  That I felt, when I heard it, quite cut to the heart.
  But now to proceed, Sire, the _Leopard_[21] I vote,
  Be razed from our list, with that ugly old _Goat_,[22]
  Who in youth made such terrible use of his jaws,
  That I dread, I confess, e'en the sight of his claws;
  And as to his muscles, 'tis said that when counted,
  To four thousand and just forty-one they amounted;
  Of Musk too, I'm told, he sheds such perfume,
  That wherever he goes, he fills the whole room.
  Exclude him we will, with the old _Dromedary_,[23]
  The _Elephant_[24] cunning, and _Fox_[25] too, so wary,
  That though I don't know it for certain, I'm told
  They cheat at Ecarté, like Hermes of old.

[Illustration: THE DEATH'S HEAD MOTH.]

  The _Ghost_[26] and _Death's head_,[27] and that terrible host,
  Would but scare all the guests"--Here the Emperor lost,
  For a moment, his patience, and cried to his spouse,
  "If thus you proceed, ma'am, my anger you'll rouse.
  Like th' Egyptians of old, I'll have at my feast
  A figure of death, or his cross-bones at least,
  To remind all our guests of the limited span
  That to moths is allotted, as well as to man,
  And how e'en in the midst of enjoyment's gay hour,
  We are still in death's stern and inflexible power.
  So let them have cards, and I'll go and prepare
  For receiving our friends, the best possible fare."
  The Monarch then went with the _Eyed Hawk_,[28] his scout,
  To search for a spot fit for giving his rout;
  A green ring he found, the work of a fairy,
  And thinking it looked both commodious and airy,
  He called to him _Brimstone_[29] to measure the ground,
  For another _Geometra_[30] could not be found;
  Of this workman he knew the correctness full well,
  What he wrought was as nice as if done by a spell.
  The spot was judged proper, and erected in haste
  Were some well fashioned rooms, which displayed his good taste.
  _Carpet Moths_[31] were appointed to stencil the floor,
  The _Clothes Moths_[32] with gossamer covered the door;
  _Mahogany_[33] and _Wainscot_[34] were neither deficient
  In offering their aid, which proved most efficient,
  While _Veneers_,[35] both rosy and yellow, were able
  T'improve, by their help, the decayed supper table.
  For the crockery, _China Mark_[36] promised to strive,
  And _Galleria_[37] offered to steal from a hive,
  Profusion of honey; _Pinguinalis_[38] brought butter,
  And with wax _Cereana_[39] came all in a flutter.
  These presents the Emperor gladly accepted,
  Save Galleria's theft, which with scorn was rejected,
  So little do moths of great minds patronise
  The base who by fraud or extortion would rise.
  In the mean time the Empress her _Swifts_[40] had sent out
  To deliver the cards for this elegant rout.
  _Puss_[41] sent an excuse, with the _Kitten_[42] engaged,
  And the _Eggar_,[43] poor lady, was highly enraged
  That her numerous offspring requiring her care,
  Prevented her joining a party so rare.
  The _Burnets_,[44] _Brown Pinioned_,[45] the _Dingy Brocades_,[46]
  The _Black Raven Feather_,[47] and sweet _Angle Shades_,[48]
  Had promised that day with the _Tussock_[49] to dine,
  A lady of fashion, whose hour was nine;
  But when they received their dread sovereign's command,
  They yielded to custom's imperious demand,
  For moths with us mortals in this do agree,
  That all parties must bow to a monarch's decree.
  Lady _Lappet_[50] being ill, the _Poplar Lutestring_[51]
  The two Misses _Nonpareil_[52] promised to bring;
  And the _Spectacle Moth_,[53] too near sighted to go,
  Sent his ward the _Bright Eye_,[54] with the _Flame Furbelow_,[55]
  Whose young lover, the beautiful, brave _Unicorn_,[56]
  Had been shot in a duel with the _Red Striped Hawthorn_.[57]
  Not quite fit to appear, the gallant _Swallow Tail_[58]
  At the doctors with anger continued to rail,
  He having been lamed by the awkward _Bulrush_,[59]
  To the serious alarm of the fair _Maiden's Blush_.[60]
  The day now arrived, and at nine of the night,
  The glow-worm being hired the highways to light,
  The guests 'gan to assemble, and each was announced
  By the _Herald_,[61] who loudly their names all pronounced.
  The _Ermine_,[62] a lady of noble degree,
  Introduced a long train of her large family;
  Some in _Muslin_,[63] some _Satin_,[64] were chastely arrayed,
  While the _Emerald_,[65] the _Pearl_,[66] and the _Mocha_[67]
        displayed
  Their jewels so costly, that poor _Burnished Brass_[68]
  Unnoticed was suffered the evening to pass.
  From the banks of the Niger the _Blackamoor_[69] brought
  A fat _Moor_,[70] who presented a _Tyger_[71] just caught;
  An old _Gentlewoman_[72] had promised to bring
  A musical Miss, who divinely could sing,
  But whose fair head, no larger than that of a _Dot_,[73]
  Was filled with the thought of a _True Lover's Knot_;[74]
  So she hem'd and she ha'd, then unblushingly told,
  How she caught as she came a most violent cold,
  And felt such oppression and pain in her throat,
  That she scarcely dared venture to utter a note;
  And thus with most Misses of human creation,
  How often their colds are but mere affectation.
  The dancing began, and soft music was heard,
  Provided, 'twas said, by the sweet _Humming Bird_.[75]
  Old Colonel _Gold Spangle_,[76] his dancing days past,
  Volunteered with good humour the dances to cast;
  To the forward Miss _Portland_[77] Captain _Christian_[78] he brought,
  Who, aided by Mars, the young lady had caught,
  For moths, like their betters, as I have been told,
  Are mightily taken with scarlet and gold.
  The _Foresters_[79] danced, arrayed all in green,
  With the _Clear Wings_,[80] whose beauty gave life to the scene;
  The _Mouse_,[81] quite enamoured, entreated in vain
  The hand of the lovely _Pease Blossom_[82] to gain,
  And the _Satellite_,[83] though he till now had sat still,
  Made up to the _Seraph_[84] to dance a quadrille.
  The _Quakers_,[85] who ne'er had been seen at a ball,
  With the _Coronets_[86] galloped around the great hall,
  And the sad _Mourning Widow_,[87] her weeds put away,
  To waltz with the lustrous _Japan_,[88] now quite gay;
  While the _Magpie_[89] obtained universal applause,
  By fluttering a hornpipe upon his hind claws.
  The _Vapourer_[90] came not, but he was no loss,
  For wherever he went he was stupid and cross;
  And his wife, an old dowdy, bereft of all wings,
  Was unfit to appear as th' associate of Kings;
  The _Dagger_[91] came armed, and looked all around,
  But his charmer, Miss _Snout_,[92] was no where to be found,
  For she had not been asked, and the _Figure of Eight_,[93]
  With his cousin, the _Sprawler_,[94] joined the party so late,
  That morn was forth peeping, and the dancing had done,
  When _Spring Usher_[95] announced the young beautiful _Nun_.[96]
  The _Gnomana_[97] now indexed the hour of four,
  The guests were assembled around the great door,
  Which the _Lacqueys_[98] threw open, and each in his rank
  Found a seat for himself, and they all ate and drank
  With a relish that would not disgrace the Guildhall,
  (To compare for a moment such great things with small,)
  Where London's Lord Mayor and his Aldermen deign
  To feast upon turtle, and tipple champagne.
  Old _Drinker_,[99] the butler, of wine served the best,
  And a _Footman_[100] was placed at the chair of each guest,
  In orange, in yellow, or black coats dressed out,
  For their liveries, 'twas said, were all made for the rout,
  The Emperor began mirth and glee to inspire,
  When a loud cry was heard, of "the chimney's on fire;"
  All started in fear from the table to learn
  If the house was in flames, or likely to burn;
  Each snatched up a candle, so left the room dark,
  And the moment was seized by the _Chamomile Shark_[101]
  To plunder the table. The _Yorkshire Magpie_[102]
  Strove also with his share of booty to fly,
  But was stopped by the _Lacqueys_, who then in a trice
  Demolished themselves every thing that was nice.

[Illustration: THE ALARM.]

  'Midst this glorious confusion a mischievous _Pug_[103]
  Contrived of the claret to empty each jug,
  But not unperceived by young _Miss Exclamation_,[104]
  Who by her loud cries caused immense consternation.
  Meanwhile came the _Sweep_,[105] with the _Chimney Sweep's Boy_,[106]
  And two other _Assistants_,[107] who ran to employ
  Every means they could think of to put out the flame,
  In which they succeeded, and found that the blame
  Belonged to the _Housewife_,[108] who had thrown in the fire
  Some grease, which occasioned the accident dire.
  The guests in a panic had now left alone
  The Emperor and Empress their ills to bemoan.
  Said the Empress, "My dear, let us never more try
  With the Butterflies' party so vainly to vie;
  For what with the heat, the fatigue, and the fright,
  I never before passed so trying a night;
  I would not again undergo the vexation
  Of such a soirée, for the wealth of a nation."
  "With you I agree," the sage Emperor replied,
  Who deemed it a lesson to cure them of pride;
  "And I trust that the thread of our lives will spin out,
  Ere we ever again attempt such a rout.
  Alas! we must own we were never designed
  To flit in the sunshine, or soar on the wind;
  Nature's changeless decree has allotted its share
  To each beast of the field, to each bird of the air,
  To each reptile that creeps, to each insect that flies;
  And who dares to rebel against nature but dies?"


    [1] _Saturnia pavonia minor._ The caterpillars of these moths are
        of a beautiful green, with blue spots, and after living
        together for three weeks, they separate, and disperse
        themselves in all directions. The Chrysalis is covered with a
        strongly glutinous matter, which resists not only weather, but
        the perforation of other insects. The Pavonia Major is the
        largest of European moths, and, according to Latreille, a
        manufactory of silk from the cocoons has been established in
        Germany.

    [2] _Pterophorus pentadactylus._ Large White Plume. By some called
        Ragged Robin. The moths of this genus have their wings divided,
        or formed of feathers united at the base. The chrysalis is
        black.

    [3] Female of the _Saturnia pavonia minor_.

    [4] _Pygæra bucephala._

    [5] _Endromis versicolor._

    [6] _Noctua catana._

    [7] _Noctua aprilina._

    [8] _Noctua batis._

    [9] The attitude of the caterpillars, resembling that of the
        Sphinx, has given this name to the tribe. The moths of the
        Sphinx have the peculiar power of erecting their wings, but
        even these cannot make them meet over the back as butterflies
        do. Their chief food is the potatoe plant.

   [10] _Liparis dispar._--The caterpillars of the Gipsey are very
        destructive to fruit trees, over which they wander during the
        day, but at night retire into a web like that of a spider. In
        1731, they attacked and destroyed most of the oaks in France.

   [11] _Noctua mi._--Called Shipton, from the profile of an old woman
        which is marked on its upper wings.

   [12] _Noctua I niger._--The Roman character, I, is marked on the
        wings of this moth.

   [13] [14] [15] _Noctua lambda_, _Noctua gamma_, _Noctua chi._--So
        named from the spots on their wings resembling these Greek
        characters. The caterpillars of the Noctua gamma, in 1735,
        infected the whole of France, and devoured the productions of
        the kitchen gardens. The common people supposed them to be
        poisonous, and consequently the use of herbs in making soups
        was forbidden.

   [16] _Noctua gothica._

   [17] _Noctua typica._

   [18] _Pyralis genus._--The Tabby is often found in the tea chests in
        the East India warehouses, where it commits great ravages. It
        never is met with, however, in a chest that is not cracked,
        thereby proving its English origin.

   [19] _Noctua nigra._--Black rustic. _Noctua lævis._--Grey rustic.
        _Noctua obsoletissima._--Brown rustic. _Noctua phæa._--Feathered
        rustic. _Noctua tinea._--Flounced rustic.

   [20] _Notodonta camelina._--The singular name of Coxcomb Prominent,
        was given to this moth from the crest on its thorax, which
        resembles that of a cock. The specific name was bestowed in
        consequence of two lobes on its upper wings, which it raises
        when at rest.

   [21] _Zeuzera æsculus._--The caterpillar feeds on the wood of apple
        trees, but the moth is often found in great abundance in St.
        James's Park; sixty were gathered there in one morning, but the
        greater number had been half devoured by the birds.

   [22] _Cossus ligniperda._--The caterpillar lives in the interior of
        trees, and has, according to Lyonet, 4041 muscles. It is three
        years before the insect attains its perfect state. The
        caterpillar emits a smell much resembling that of musk, and Ray
        and Linnæus both supposed it to be the Cossus mentioned by Pliny,
        as fattened with flour by the Roman epicures for their tables.
        Later writers have, however, for many reasons, ascribed this to
        the larva of the stag beetle.

   [23] _Notodonta dromedarius._--This Notodonta is called Dromedary,
        from having two crests, similar to humps, on its thorax.

   [24] _Sphinx elpenor._--The caterpillars of the Elephant feed on the
        plant called Ladies' Bedstraw, (_Galium palustre_), from which
        they are often shaken by the wind into the water. When this
        happens, they dexterously turn themselves on their backs, make
        head and tail meet, and float in this posture till they can
        contrive to save themselves by clinging to some part of the
        plant. They possess the power of drawing the head and three
        first joints within the body at pleasure. The moth flies very
        late at night, and is rarely caught.

   [25] _Lasiocampa rubi._--The Fox moth is chiefly found on heaths and
        commons, and lives in the caterpillar state all the winter.

   [26] _Hepialus humuli._--The male moth is of a beautiful and
        brilliant white, but the female is yellow. It is fond of feeding
        on the roots of grass, and from having been often found in
        church-yards, the tradition has arisen that it inhabits those
        spots only. The caterpillar is very destructive to hops, by
        devouring the roots.

   [27] _Sphinx atropos._--This is called the Death's Head moth from the
        resemblance of the spot on its thorax to a human skull. It is
        the largest of the Sphinx tribe, and is vulgarly regarded as the
        messenger of pestilence and death. When touched it utters a
        plaintive cry, like that of a bat or mouse. Reaumur says, that a
        whole convent in France was thrown into consternation, by one of
        these moths flying into the dormitory. It frequently robs hives,
        and Huber states, that its cry renders the bees motionless. It
        breaks from its chrysalis between four and seven in the
        afternoon, as the Hawk moth of the Lime always appears at noon,
        and that of the Evening Primrose at sunrise.

   [28] _Sphinx cellata._--The Eyed-hawk moth flies very swiftly by
        night, and its caterpillar is very beautiful.

   [29] _Geometra cratægaria._--The Brimstone lays eggs twice in the
        same year.

   [30] This genus is so called from the peculiar manner in which the
        caterpillar moves; it brings the feet of both extremities close
        together, and the intermediate part of the body rises like an
        arch, giving it the appearance of measuring the distance it
        performs. It is said to possess great muscular powers, for it
        will attach its posterior feet to the twig of a tree, and erect
        the rest of its body in a vertical position for hours without
        moving.

   [31] _Geometra subtristata._--&c. &c.

   [32] _Tinea genus._--These are the moths which cause so much
        destruction to furs, and other articles of clothing. They lay
        their eggs on the substances which serve them for food. The most
        effectual method of keeping them away is to pack the materials
        in a well-closed tin box, and enclose with them a tallow candle.

   [33] _Noctua tetra._

   [34] _Leucania._--Genus of Stephens.

   [35] _Crambus carnea._--Rosy veneer. _Crambus arborum._--Yellow satin
        veneer. They receive their name from the streaks on their wings.
        They are chiefly found on grasses in flower, and always settled
        with their heads downwards.

   [36] _Botys genus._--Called China mark, from the resemblance of the
        spots on the wings to those on old China.

   [37] _Galleria alvearia._--The caterpillar lives on honey.

   [38] _Aglossa pinguinalis._--The food of the caterpillar consists of
        fat substances, such as butter or lard, in which it will suffer
        itself to be completely enveloped without injury. It is
        sometimes said to get into the human stomach, when it causes
        very dangerous symptoms.

   [39] _Galleria cereana._--The caterpillar feeds on wax, but for want
        of this food will eat paper, wafers, &c.

   [40] _Hepialus genus._--The gold Swift sometimes moves slowly through
        the air, a few feet from the ground, where it poises itself; at
        others, vacillates like the pendulum of a clock, and again
        altering its motion, darts about with great rapidity.

   [41] _Cerura vinula._--The caterpillar of the Puss has the power of
        stretching out, or pulling back its head at will, according to
        its apprehension of danger. Its hinder extremity never touches
        the ground, but is furnished with two tubes, through which the
        insect ejects a thin liquor at its pursuers. When near the
        change into the pupa state, however, the tubes dry up, and it
        loses this faculty. More male than female moths are to be found,
        which is contrary to the general rule.

   [42] _Cerura furcula._--The kitten.

   [43] _Lasiocampa quercus._--The Eggar has been known to remain
        seven years in the chrysalis state.

   [44] _Zygæna genus._

   [45] _Noctua oblonga._

   [46] _Noctua obscura._

   [47] _Porrectaria grandipennis._

   [48] _Noctua meticulosa._--The chrysalis of the Angle-shades is of a
        deep red colour, with two sharp points at the tail. The
        caterpillar is of a fine transparent green.

   [49] _Laria genus._--The Tussock feeds on white thorn, and is the
        hop-dog of the hop-gatherers in Kent.

   [50] _Gastropacha quercifolia._--The caterpillar of this moth also
        lives through the winter, a fact recently discovered by Mr.
        Samouelle, from whose obliging communications many of these
        notes have been derived.

   [51] _Noctua flavicornis._

   [52] _Noctua fraxini._--The Nonpareils are very scarce in England,
        are very large moths, and have blue under-wings.

   [53] _Noctua triplacea._--Named Spectacle moth, from an appearance
        like spectacles on its thorax.

   [54] _Noctua conigera._--Brown line. Bright eye.

   [55] _Noctua furca._

   [56] _Sphinx convolvuli._--The unicorn caterpillar is difficult to
        find, from its habit of hiding itself in the ground, and only
        appearing on the surface in the evening to feed on the lesser
        bindweed, at which time it is frequently sought by collectors
        with a candle and lanthorn. The Pupa has an enormous rostrum,
        longer than the insect, and very thick, probably to contain the
        proboscis.

   [57] _Tinea bistriga._--These are beautiful minute insects, and are
        found on the white thorn in July.

   [58] _Geometra sambucaria._--This is found in lanes, and is
        remarkable for the elegance of its flight.

   [59] _Noctua typhæ._--The caterpillar feeds on the pith of the
        bulrush.

   [60] _Geometra punctaria._--The Maiden's Blush flies in the shady
        parts of woods at sunset.

   [61] _Noctua libatrix._

   [62] _Erminea padi._--This insect destroys the white thorn hedges in
        the neighbourhood of London. About three years back, a dress was
        woven by the caterpillars for the Queen of Bavaria. A model was
        made of some stiff material, and the caterpillars placed on it;
        they covered it with their web, and thus produced a garment
        without a seam.

   [63] _Arctia mendica._

   [64] _Arctia salicis._--The Satin moth not only itself wears the
        appearance of this substance, but covers its eggs with a web
        which has the same resemblance.

   [65] _Geometra papilio naria._--[66] _Noctua perla._--[67] _Geometra
        omicromaria._--These moths in colour resemble the stones, &c.,
        after which they are named. The Emerald becomes white with
        keeping, and the others turn to a dirty yellow.

   [68] _Noctua chrysitis._--The upper wings of the moth are of a
        light brown, and streaked across with two bands resembling
        polished brass.

   [69] _Noctua Ethiops._--So named from its dark appearance.

   [70] _Noctua Maura._--The Moor has a broad body, and is constantly
        found under the arches of Westminster Bridge.

   [71] _Arctia caja._--The caterpillar mixes its own hair with its web.
        It is found in gardens, feeds on every thing, and changes its
        skin ten times.

   [72] _Noctua brassica._--The caterpillar is very destructive to
        cabbages.

   [73] _Noctua persicaria._--This moth is remarkable for a white spot
        on its wing, and the caterpillar feeds on the flower from which
        it is named.

   [74] _Noctua erica._--The appearance of a true lover's knot is found
        on its upper wings.

   [75] _Macroglossum stellatarum._--It makes a humming noise with the
        vibration of its wings. It is found from March till September,
        hovering over geraniums, and constantly appears at two o'clock
        in the afternoon.

   [76] _Noctua bractea._--This is a rare insect, and receives its name
        from the large spot in each upper wing, resembling burnished
        gold.

   [77] _Noctua precox._--This moth was named after the Duchess of
        Portland, who first found it.

   [78] _Tortrix genus._--The genus receives its name from the faculty
        possessed by the caterpillar, of rolling or twisting the leaves
        of the plants it inhabits, into a tubular form. The Christian,
        or Christianern, is found in the chalk pits of Kent, resting on
        cinque-foil. The upper wings are of a bright yellow, streaked
        with scarlet.

   [79] _Ino statices._--The body and wings are of a beautiful metallic
        green, and they chiefly inhabit meadows.

   [80] _Ægeria genus._--They receive their name from the transparency
        of their wings. They are principally found on the wood of the
        currant tree.

   [81] _Noctua tragopogonus._--Called Mouse from its colour.

   [82] _Noctua delphinii._--The Pease blossom is a very beautiful, but
        rare moth. It feeds on the wild larkspur, and lies in the pupa
        state from August till the June following.

   [83] _Noctua satellitia._--The caterpillars of the Satellite are
        great enemies to white thorn, currant, and gooseberry bushes,
        and also to other caterpillars.

   [84] _Geometra hexapterata._--The Seraph, or Seraphim, has two little
        processes like the rudiments of another pair of wings, whence
        its specific name.

   [85] _Noctua cerasi, &c._--These moths are remarkably neat in
        appearance.

   [86] _Noctua ligustri._--The Coronets are so called from their
        crested thorax.

   [87] _Geometra luctuaria._

   [88] _Adela genus._--The Japan moths are distinguished by the length
        of their antennae, which several times exceed the length of
        their bodies.

   [89] _Abraxas grossulariata._--The destructive caterpillar of this
        moth lives in gardens, through the winter, and feeds on the buds
        as they begin to open. When about to change to the chrysalis
        state, they suspend themselves by the tail.

   [90] _Bombyx antiqua._--The female moth is destitute of wings, and
        the male is constantly seen, slowly fluttering through the
        streets of London.

   [91] _Noctua psi._--The Dagger is produced from a light green egg,
        and is named from the mark on its wings.

   [92] _Herminia rostralis._--Called Snout, from the form of the palpi,
        which project over the head.

   [93] _Bombyx cæruleocephala._--It owes its English name to the figure
        of eight, marked in white on its brown wings.

   [94] _Bombyx cassinea._--The Sprawler is found on palings, closely
        adhering to the wood, and rests with its anterior feet widely
        spread out.

   [95] _Geometra leucophearia._--This is named Spring Usher from making
        its appearance in February; it is a favourite food with
        insectivorous birds.

   [96] _Noctua aprica._

   [97] _Tortrix gnomana._--Dial moth. It flies from side to side like
        the pendulum of a clock.

   [98] _Lasiocampa neustria, &c._--The caterpillars live in a common
        web, and are striped with white, blue, and red, whence, by the
        French naturalists, they are called _livrée_. They are
        polyphagus, _i. e._ they eat every thing. They lay their eggs
        in close, compact rings, round the twigs of trees.

   [99] _Odenensis potatoria._--The caterpillar of this moth
        (according to Godart) after drinking, lifts up its head like a
        hen, whence it receives its name.

  [100] _Lithosia aurantia_ (orange)--_Lithosia luterella_ (yellow)
        _Lithosia rubricollis_ (black)--Footman.

  [101] _Noctua chamomilla._--The moth attaches itself close to the
        edges of wood, as near its own colour as possible.

  [102] _Abraxas ulmaria._--Found abundantly in Yorkshire.

  [103] _Geometra genus._

  [104] _Noctua exclamationis._

  [105] _Geometra chærophyllata._--All the moths called Chimney-sweeps
        are black, but the Chimney-sweep's boy is smaller than the
        others, and easily distinguished by the glossiness of its
        wings.

  [106] _Fumaria plumistra._

  [107] _Geometra euphorbiata_, &c.

  [108] _Geometra thymiaria._--All collectors will recognise this as a
        very probable accident from the quantity of grease natural to
        moths, and which often destroys their finest specimens. The
        localities of these and other insects, with more particulars,
        may be found ably described in Mr. Samouelle's valuable work
        on Entomology.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
