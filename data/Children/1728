[Illustration: GIRLS AND BOYS]


[Music:

1. Girls and boys come out to play,
   The moon doth shine as bright as day;
   Leave your supper, and leave your sleep;
   Come to your playfellows in the street;

2. Come with a whoop, and come with a call.
   Come with a good will or not at all.
   Up the ladder and down the wall,
   A penny loaf will serve you all.]




[Illustration: THE MVLBERRY BVSH]


[Music:

Here we go round the mulberry bush,
the mulberry bush, the mulberry bush;
Here we go round the mulberry bush,
All on a frosty morning.

This is the way we clap our hands,
This is the way we clap our hands,
This is the way we clap our hands,
All on a frosty morning.]

[Illustration: HERE WE GO ROVND THE MVLBERRY BVSH]




[Illustration: ORANGES & LEMONS]


[Music:

Oranges and lemons, says the bells of St. Clemen's;
You owe me five farthings, says the bells of St. Martin's;
When will you pay me, says the bells of Old Bailey;
When I grow rich, says the bells of Shoreditch;
When will that be? says the bells of Stepney;
I do not know, says the great bell of Bow.

Here comes a candle to light you to bed,
And here comes a chopper to chop off your head.]




[Illustration: ST PAVL'S STEEPLE]


[Music:

Upon Paul's steeple stands a tree
As full of apples as may be,
The little boys of London town
They run with hooks to pull them down;
And then they run from hedge to hedge
Until they come to London Bridge.]




[Illustration: MY LADY'S GARDEN]


[Music:

How does my lady's garden grow?
How does my lady's garden grow?
With silver bells, and cockle shells,
And pretty maids all in a row!]

[Illustration: HOW DOES MY LADY'S GARDEN GROW?]




[Illustration: NATURAL HISTORY]


[Music:

1. What are little boys made of?
   What are little boys made of?
   Frogs and snails and puppy-dog's tails,
   And that are little boys made of.

2. What are little girls made of?
   What are little girls made of?
   Sugar and spice and all that's nice,
   And that are little girls made of.]

3. What are young men made of?
   What are young men made of?
   Sighs and leers, and crocodile tears,
   And that are young men made of.

4. What are young women made of?
   What are young women made of?
   Ribbons and laces, and sweet pretty faces,
   And that are young women made of.




[Illustration: LAVENDER'S BLUE]


[Music:

1. Lavender's blue, diddle, diddle!
     Lavender's green;
   When I am king, diddle, diddle!
     You shall be queen.]

2. Call up your men, diddle, diddle!
     Set them to work;
   Some to the plough, diddle, diddle!
     Some to the cart.

3. Some to make hay, diddle, diddle!
     Some to cut corn;
   While you and I, diddle, diddle!
     Keep ourselves warm.




[Illustration: I SAW THREE SHIPS]


[Music:

1. I saw three ships come sailing by,
   Sailing by, sailing by,
   I saw three ships come sailing by,
     On New-year's Day in the morning.

2. And what do you think was in them then,
   In them then, in them then,
   And what do you think was in them then,
     On New-year's Day in the morning?]

3. Three pretty girls were in them then,
   In them then, in them then,
   Three pretty girls were in them then,
     On New-year's Day in the morning.

4. And one could whistle, and one could sing,
   The other play on the violin;
   Such joy there was at my wedding,
     On New-year's Day in the morning.

[Illustration: I SAW THREE SHIPS]




[Illustration: DING DONG BELL]


[Music:

Ding dong bell!
Pussy's in the well!
Who put her in?
Little Tommy Lin.
Who pulled her out?
Little Tommy Stout.
What a naughty boy was that
To drown poor pussy-cat,
Who ne'er did any harm,
But killed all the mice in father's barn.]




[Illustration: PUSS AT COURT]


[Music:

"Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, where have you been?"
"I've been to London to look at the Queen."
"Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, what did you there?"
"I caught a little mouse under the chair."]




[Illustration: THREE BLIND MICE]


[Music:

Three blind mice,
See how they run!
They all ran after the farmer's wife,
Who cut off their tails with a carving knife;
Did ever you hear such a thing in your life?
Three blind mice.]




[Illustration: DICKORY DOCK]


[Music:

Hickory, dickory dock!
The mouse ran up the clock;
The clock struck one,
The mouse ran down,
Hickory, dickory dock!]




[Illustration: Ye FROG'S WOOING]


[Music:

1.

It was the frog lived in the well,
Heigh-ho! says Rowley;
And the merry mouse under the mill,
With a Rowley, Powley, Gammon, and Spinach,
Heigh-ho! says Anthony Rowley.]

2.

The frog he would a-wooing ride, Heigh-ho, &c.
Sword and buckler at his side, With a, &c.

"Lady Mouse, are you within?" With a, &c.

5.

Then came out the dusty mouse, Heigh-ho, &c.
"I am the lady of this house," With a, &c.

6.

"Hast thou any mind of me?" Heigh-ho, &c.
"I have e'en great mind of thee," With a, &c.

7.

"Who shall this marriage make?" Heigh-ho, &c.
"Our lord, which is the rat," With a, &c.

8.

"What shall we have to our supper?" Heigh-ho, &c.
"Three beans in a pound of butter," With a, &c.

9.

But when the supper they were at, Heigh-ho, &c.
The frog, the mouse, and e'en the rat, With a, &c.

10.

Then came in Tib, our cat, Heigh-ho, &c.
And caught the mouse e'en by the back, With a, &c.

And so the company parted all, With a, &c.




[Illustration: Ye FROG & Ye CROW]


[Music:

1. A jolly fat frog lived in the river swim, O!
   A comely black crow lived on the river brim, O!
   "Come on shore, come on shore,"
   Said the crow to the frog, and then, O!
   "No, you'll bite me, no, you'll bite me,"
   Said the frog to the crow again, O!]

[Illustration]

2. "O! there is sweet music on yonder green hill, O!
   And you shall be a dancer, a dancer in yellow,
   All in yellow, all in yellow."
   Said the crow to the frog, and then, O!
   "All in yellow, all in yellow,"
   Said the frog to the crow again, O!

3. "Farewell, ye little fishes, that in the river swim, O!
   I'm going to be a dancer, a dancer in yellow."
   "O beware! O beware!"
   Said the fish to the frog, and then, O!
   "I'll take care, I'll take care,"
   Said the frog to the fish again, O!

4. The frog began a swimming, a swimming to land, O!
   And the crow began jumping to give him his hand, O!
   "Sir, you're welcome, Sir, you're welcome,"
   Said the crow to the frog, and then, O!
   "Sir, I thank you, Sir, I thank you."
   Said the frog to the crow, again, O!

5. "But where is the sweet music on yonder green hill, O?
   And where are all the dancers, the dancers in yellow?
   All in yellow, all in yellow?"
   Said the frog to the crow, and then, O!
   "Sir, they're here, Sir, they're here."
   Said the crow to the frog--[A]

[Footnote A: Here the crow swallows the frog.]




[Illustration: MRS. BOND]


[Music:

1. "Oh, what have you got for dinner, Mrs. Bond?"
   "There's beef in the larder, and ducks in the pond;"
   "Dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, come to be killed,
   For you must be stuffed, and my customers filled!"]

2. "John Ostler, go fetch me a duckling or two,
   John Ostler go fetch me a duckling or two;
   Cry dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, come and be killed,
   For you must be stuffed, and my customers filled!"

3. "I have been to the ducks that are swimming in the pond,
   And they won't come to be killed, Mrs. Bond;
   I cried dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, come and be killed,
   For you must be stuffed, and the customers filled!"

4. Mrs. Bond she went down to the pond in a rage,
   With plenty of onions, and plenty of sage;
   She cried, "Come, little wag-tails, come, and be killed.
   For you shall be stuffed, and my customers filled!"

[Illustration: MRS. BOND]




[Illustration: XMAS DAY IN Ye MORNING]


[Music:

1. Dame, get up and bake your pies,
   Bake your pies, bake your pies;
   Dame, get up and bake your pies,
     On Christmas-day in the morning.

2. Dame, what makes your maidens lie,
   Maidens lie, maidens lie?
   Dame, what makes your maidens lie,
     On Christmas-day in the morning?]

3. Dame, what makes your ducks to die,
   Ducks to die, ducks to die?
   Dame, what makes your ducks to die,
     On Christmas-day in the morning?

4. Their wings are cut, they cannot fly,
   Cannot fly, cannot fly;
   Their wings are cut, they cannot fly,
     On Christmas-day in the morning.




[Illustration: LITTLE IACK HORNER]


[Music:

Little Jack Horner sat in a corner,
Eating a Christmas pie;
He put in his thumb, and pulled out a plum,
And said, "What a good boy am I!"]




[Illustration: KING ARTHUR]


[Music:

1. When good King Arthur ruled this land,
     He was a goodly king--
   He stole three pecks of barley-meal,
     To make a bag pudding.]

2. A bag pudding the Queen did make,
     And stuffed it well with plums,
   And in it put great lumps of fat
     As big as my two thumbs.

3. The King and Queen did eat thereof,
     And noblemen beside,
   And what they could not eat that night
     The Queen next morning fried.

[Illustration: Ye GOOD KING ARTHUR]




[Illustration: Ye JOLLY MILLER]


[Music:

There was a jolly miller once
Lived on the river Dee;
He worked and sang from morn till night,
No lark more blithe than he.
And this the burden of his song
For ever used to be,
"I care for nobody, no, not I,
And nobody cares for me."]




[Illustration: Ye SONG of SIXPENCE]


[Music:

1. Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket fall of rye;
   Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie;
   When the pie was open the birds began to sing,
   Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before the king?]

2. The king was in his counting-house counting out his money;
   The queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey;
   The maid was in the garden hanging out her clothes,
   When up came a blackbird and pecked off her nose.




[Illustration: BO-PEEP]


[Music:

1. Little Bo-Peep, she lost her sheep,
     And didn't know where to find them;
   Let them alone, they'll all come home
     And bring their tails behind them.]

2. Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep,
     And dreamt she heard them bleating;
   But when she awoke, she found it a joke,
     For they were still a-fleeting.

3. Then up she took her little crook,
     Determined for to find them,
   She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed
     For they'd left their tails behind them.

4. It happened one day as Bo-Peep did stray
     Into a meadow hard by,
   There she espied their tails side by side,
     All hung on a tree to dry.

5. She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye,
     Then went o'er hill and dale,
   And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,
     To tack to each sheep its tail.

[Illustration: LITTLE BO-PEEP]




[Illustration: BAA! BAA! BLACK SHEEP]


[Music:

"Baa! Baa! Black sheep, have you any wool?"
"Yes, marry, have I, three bags full;
One for my master, and one for my dame,
But none for the little boy that lives down the lane!"]




[Illustration: TOM, THE PIPER'S SON]


[Music:

Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
Stole a pig and away did run;
The pig was eat, and Tom was beat,
And Tom went roaring down the street.]




[Illustration: THERE WAS A LADY LOVED A SWINE]


[Music:

1. There was a lady loved a swine,
     "Honey!" said she;
   "Pig-hog, wilt thou be mine?"
     "Hunc!" said he.

2. "I'll build thee a silver sty,
     Honey!" said she;
   "And in it thou shalt lie!"
     "Hunc!" said he.]

3. "Pinned with a silver pin,
     Honey!" said she;
   "That thou mayest go out and in,"
     "Hunc!" said he.

4. "Will thou have me now,
     Honey?" said she;
   "Speak, or my heart will break,"
     "Hunc!" said he.

[Illustration: THERE WAS A LADY LOVED A SWINE]




[Illustration: OVER THE HILLS & FAR AWAY]


[Music:

1. Tom he was a piper's son,
   He learnt to play when he was young;
   But all the tunes that he could play
   Was "Over the hills and far away."
     Over the hills and a great way off,
     The wind shall blow my top-knot off.]

2. Tom with his pipe made such a noise
   That he pleased both the girls and boys,
   And they stopped to hear him play,
   "Over the hills and far away."
     Over the hills, &c.




[Illustration: COCK ROBIN AND JENNY WREN]


[Music:

1. 'Twas on a merry time,
     When Jenny Wren was young,
   So neatly as she danced,
     And so sweetly as she sung,
   Robin Redbreast lost his heart,
     He was a gallant bird,
   He doffed his cap to Jenny Wren,
     Requesting to be heard.

2. "My dearest Jenny Wren,
     If you will but be mine,
   You shall dine on cherry pie,
     And drink nice currant wine;
   I'll dress you like a gold-finch,
     Or like a peacock gay,
   So if you'll have me, Jenny, dear,
     Let us appoint the day."]

3. Jenny blushed behind her fan
     And thus declared her mind--
   "So let it be to-morrow, Rob,
     I'll take your offer kind;
   Cherry pie is very good,
     And so is currant wine,
   But I will wear my plain brown gown,
     And never dress too fine."

4. Robin Redbreast got up early,
     All at the break of day,
   He flew to Jenny Wren's house,
     And sang a roundelay;
   He sang of Robin Redbreast,
     And pretty Jenny Wren,
   And when he came unto the end,
     He then began again.




[Illustration: I HAD A LITTLE NVT-TREE]


[Music:

I had a little nut-tree, nothing would it bear
But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear;
The King of Spain's daughter came to visit me,
And all for the sake of my little nut-tree.]

[Illustration: I HAD A LITTLE NVT-TREE]




[Illustration: DR. FAVSTVS]


[Music:

Doctor Faustus was a good man,
He whipt his scholars now and then;
When he whipt he made them dance
Out of England into France;
Out of France into Spain,
And then he whipt them back again.]




[Illustration: THREE CHILDREN]


[Music:

1. Three children sliding on the ice,
     All on a summer's day,
   As it fell out, they all fell in,
     The rest they ran away.]

2. Now, had these children been at home,
     Or sliding on dry ground,
   Ten thousand pounds to one penny,
     They had not all been drowned.

3. You parents all that children have,
     And you that have got none,
   If you would have them safe abroad,
     Pray keep them safe at home.




[Illustration: MY PRETTY MAID]


[Music:

1. "Where are you going to, my pretty maid?
   Where are you going to, my pretty maid?"
   "I'm going a-milking, Sir," she said,
   "Sir," she said, "Sir," she said,
   "I'm going a-milking, Sir," she said.]

2. "Shall I go with you, my pretty maid?"
   "Yes, if you please, kind Sir," she said,
   "Sir," she said, "Sir," she said,
   "Yes, if you please, kind Sir," she said.

3. "What is your fortune, my pretty maid?"
   "My face is my fortune, Sir," she said,
   "Sir," she said, "Sir," she said,
   "My face is my fortune, Sir," she said.

4. "Then I can't marry you, my pretty maid."
   "Nobody asked you, Sir," she said,
   "Sir," she said, "Sir," she said,
   "Nobody asked you, Sir," she said.

[Illustration: WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO MY PRETTY MAID?]




[Illustration: THE PLOVGH BOY IN LVCK]


[Music:

1. My daddy is dead, but I can't tell you how;
   He left me six horses to follow the plough;
     With my whim wham waddle ho!
     Strim stram straddle ho!
     Bubble ho! pretty boy, over the brow.]

2. I sold my six horses to buy me a cow;
   And wasn't that a pretty thing to follow the plough?
     With my, &c.

3. I sold my cow to buy me a calf,
   For I never made a bargain but I lost the best half.
     With my, &c.

4. I sold my calf to buy me a cat,
   To sit down before the fire to warm her little back.
     With my, &c.

5. I sold my cat to buy me a mouse,
   But she took fire in her tail and so burnt up my house.
     With my, &c.




[Illustration: WARM HANDS]


[Music:

Warm hands, warm, thy men are gone to plough;
If you want to warm your hands, warm your hands now.]




[Illustration: JACK AND JILL]


[Music:

Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water;
Jack fell down and broke his crown,
And Jill came tumbling after.]

[Illustration: JACK & JILL.]




[Illustration: DANCE A BABY]


[Music:

Dance a baby diddy!
What can mammy do wid'e?
Sit in her lap,
Give it some pap,
And dance a baby diddy!]




[Illustration: HVSH-A-BY BABY]


[Music:

Hush-a-by baby on the tree-top,
When the wind blows the cradle will rock;
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall--
Down comes baby, cradle and all!]




[Illustration: KING COLE]


[Music:

Old King Cole was a merry old soul,
And a merry old soul was he;
He called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl,
And he called for his fiddlers three.
Ev'ry fiddler had a fiddle,
And a very fine fiddle had he.

Tweedle dee, tweedle dee, tweedle dee, tweedle dee,
Tweedle dee, tweedle dee, went the fiddlers three,
O there's none so rare as can compare
With King Cole and his fiddlers three.]


FINIS

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: [back cover]]

[Music:

Hey diddle diddle! the cat and the fiddle,
The cow skipt over the moon;
The little dog laughed to see the fine sport,
And the dish ran away with the spoon.]

or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
