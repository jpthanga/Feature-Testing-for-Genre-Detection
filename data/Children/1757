SLOVENLY BETSY


    Betsy would never wash herself
    When from her bed she rose,
    But just as quickly as she could
    She hurried on her clothes.
    To keep her clothes all nice and clean
    Miss Betsy took no pains;
    In holes her stockings always were,
    Her dresses filled with stains.
    Sometimes she went day after day
    And never combed her hair,
    While little feathers from her bed
    Stuck on it here and there.
    The schoolboys, when they Betsy saw,
    Would point her out, and cry,
    "Oh! Betsy, what a sight you are!
    Oh! Slovenly Betsy, fie!"

    One rainy day her parents went
    Some pleasant friends to meet.
    They took Betsy along with them,
    All dressed so clean and neat.
    Nice little boys and girls were there,
    With whom our Betsy played,
    Until of playing she grew tired,
    And to the garden strayed.
    Out in the rain she danced awhile,
    But 'twas not long before
    Flat down she tumbled in the mud,
    And her best clothes she tore.

[Illustration]

    Oh! what a sight she was, indeed,
    When in the room she came;
    The guests all loudly laughed at her,
    And she almost died with shame.
    She turned, and to her home she ran,
    And then, as here you see,
    She washed her clothes, and since has been
    As neat as she could be.

PHOEBE ANN, THE PROUD GIRL


    This Phoebe Ann was a very proud girl,
    Her nose had always an upward curl.

[Illustration]

    She thought herself better than all others beside,
    And beat even the peacock himself in pride.

[Illustration]

    She thought the earth was so dirty and brown,
    That never, by chance, would she look down;
    And she held up her head in the air so high
    That her neck began stretching by and by.
    It stretched and it stretched; and it grew so long
    That her parents thought something must be wrong.
    It stretched and stretched, and they soon began
    To look up with fear at their Phoebe Ann.

[Illustration]

    They prayed her to stop her upward gaze,
    But Phoebe kept on in her old proud ways,
    Until her neck had grown so long and spare
    That her head was more than her neck could bear--
    And it bent to the ground, like a willow tree,
    And brought down the head of this proud Phoebe,
    Until whenever she went out a walk to take,
    The boys would shout, "Here comes a snake!"

[Illustration]

    Her head got to be so heavy to drag on,
    That she had to put it on a little wagon.
    So don't, my friends, hold your head too high,
    Or your neck may stretch, too, by and by.

THE DREADFUL STORY OF PAULINE AND THE MATCHES


    Mamma and Nurse went out one day,
    And left Pauline alone at play;
    Around the room she gayly sprang,
    Clapp'd her hands, and danced, and sang.
    Now, on the table close at hand,
    A box of matches chanced to stand,
    And kind Mamma and Nurse had told her,
    That if she touched them they would scold her.
    But Pauline said, "Oh, what a pity!
    For when they burn it is so pretty;
    They crackle so, and spit, and flame;
    And Mamma often burns the same.
    I'll only light a match or two
    As I have often seen my mother do."

[Illustration]

    When Minz and Maunz, the cats, heard this,
    They said, "Oh, naughty, naughty Miss.
    Me-ow!" they cried, "Me-ow, me-o,
    You'll burn to death, if you do so.
    Mamma forbids it, don't you know?"

    But Pauline would not take advice,
    She lit a match, it was so nice!
    It crackled so, it burned so clear,--
    Exactly like the picture here.
    She jumped for joy and ran about,
    And was too pleased to put it out.

[Illustration]

    When Minz and Maunz, the cats, saw this,
    They said, "Oh, naughty, naughty Miss!"
    And rais'd their paws
    And stretch'd their claws;
    "'Tis very, very wrong, you know;
    Me-ow, me-o, me-ow, me-o!
    You will be burnt if you do so.
    Mamma forbids it, don't you know?"

    Now see! oh, see! a dreadful thing!
    The fire has caught her apron string:
    Her apron burns, her arms, her hair;
    She burns all over, everywhere.

[Illustration]

    Then how the pussy cats did mew,
    What else, poor pussies, could they do?
    They screamed for help, 'twas all in vain,
    So then they said, "We'll scream again.
    Make haste, make haste! Me-ow! me-o!
    She'll burn to death--we told her so."

    Pauline was burnt with all her clothes,
    And arms and hands, and eyes and nose;
    Till she had nothing more to lose
    Except her little scarlet shoes;
    And nothing else but these was found
    Among her ashes on the ground.
    And when the good cats sat beside
    The smoking ashes, how they cried,
    "Me-ow, me-o! Me-ow, me-oo!
    What will Mamma and Nursey do?"
    Their tears ran down their cheeks so fast
    They made a little pond at last.

[Illustration]




WHAT HAPPENED TO LAZY CHARLOTTE


    "Here, Charlotte," said Mamma one day.
    "These stockings knit while I'm away,
    And should you fail, be sure you'll find
    Mamma is strict, although she's kind."

[Illustration]

  But Charlotte took a lazy fit,
    And did not feel inclined to knit;
    And soon upon the ground let fall
    Needles, and worsted, hose, and all.
    "I shall not knit," said she, "not I;
    At least not now, but by and by;"
    Then stretched, and yawned, and rubbed her eyes,
    Like sluggards, when 'tis time to rise.

[Illustration]

    But when Mamma came home, and found
    The work all strewed upon the ground,
    Quoth she, "You will not knit, and so
    To school barefooted you shall go."

    This put poor Charlotte in a fright.
    And though she knew it served her right,
    She wept, and begged, and prayed; but still
    She could not change her mother's will.

[Illustration]

    To school, where all were spruce and neat,
    Poor Charlotte went with naked feet.
    Some showed their pity, some their pride,
    While Charlotte hid her face and cried.

[Illustration]




THE CRY-BABY


    "Oh, why are you always so bitterly crying?
    You surely will make yourself blind.
    What reason on earth for such sobbing and sighing,
    I pray, can you possibly find?
    There is no real sorrow, there's nothing distressing,
    To make you thus grieve and lament.
    Ah! no; you are just at this moment possessing
    Whatever should make you content.

[Illustration]

    Now do, my dear daughter, give over this weeping,"
    Such was a kind mother's advice.
    But all was in vain; for you see she's still keeping
    Her handkerchief up to her eyes.

[Illustration]

    But now she removes it, and oh! she discloses
    A countenance full of dismay;
    For she certainly feels, or at least she supposes
    Her eyesight is going away.
    She is not mistaken, her sight is departing;
    She knows it and sorrows the more;
    Then rubs her sore eyes, to relieve them from smarting,
    And makes them still worse than before.

[Illustration]

    And now the poor creature is cautiously crawling
    And feeling her way all around;
    And now from their sockets her eyeballs are falling;
    See, there they are down on the ground.
    My children, from such an example take warning,
    And happily live while you may;
    And say to yourselves, when you rise in the morning,
    "I'll try to be cheerful today."

[Illustration]




THE STORY OF ROMPING POLLY


    "I pray you now, my little child,"
    Thus once a kind old lady
    Spoke to her niece in accents mild,
    "Do try to be more steady.
    I know that you will often see
    Rude boys push, drive, and hurry;
    But little girls should never be
    All in a heat and flurry."

[Illustration]

    While thus the lady gave advice
    And lectured little Polly,
    To see her stand with downcast eyes,
    You'd think she'd owned her folly.
    She did, and many a promise made;
    But when her aunt departed,
    Forgetting all, the silly maid
    Off to the playground started.

[Illustration]

    Now see what frolic and what fun,
    The little folks are after;
    Away they jump, away they run,
    With many a shout and laughter.

[Illustration]

    But fools who never will be taught,
    Except by some disaster,
    Soon find their knowledge dearly bought,
    And of a cruel master.
    This little girl, who, spite of all
    Her good old aunt had spoken,
    Would romp about, had such a fall
    That her poor leg was broken.

[Illustration]

    In sore amaze, those standing by
    Then placed her on a barrow;
    But oh! to hear her scream and cry
    Their souls it sure did harrow.

[Illustration]

    See how her brother bursts in tears,
    When told the dreadful story;
    And see how carefully he bears
    The limb all wet and gory.

[Illustration]

    Full many a week, screwed up in bed,
    She lingered sad and weary;

[Illustration]

    And went on crutches, it is said,
    Until she died so dreary.

[Illustration]




THE STORY OF A DIRTY CHILD


    The little girls whom now you'll see
    Were sisters in one family;
    And both enjoyed an equal share
    Of a kind mother's anxious care.
    This one in neatness took a pride,
    And oft the brush and comb applied;

[Illustration]

    Oft washed her face, and oft her hands;
    See, now, thus occupied she stands.

[Illustration]

    The other--oh! I grieve to say
    How she would scream and run away,
    Soon as she saw her mother stand,
    With water by, and sponge in hand.
    She'd kick and stamp, and jump about,
    And set up such an awful shout,
    That one who did not know the child,
    Would say she must be going wild.

[Illustration]

    In consequence it came to pass,
    While one was quite a pretty lass,
    And many a fond admirer gained,
    And many a little gift obtained;

[Illustration]

    The other, viewed with general scorn,
    Was left forsaken and forlorn;
    For no one can endure to see
    A child all dirt and misery.
    Behold how needful 'tis that we
    Should clean in dress and person be;
    Or else, believe me, 'tis in vain
    We hope affection to obtain.

[Illustration]

    A sloven will be always viewed
    With pity by the wise and good;
    While ev'n the vicious and the base
    Behold with scorn a dirty face.

[Illustration]




ENVIOUS MINNIE


    Now Minnie was a pretty girl,
    Her hair so gracefully did curl;
    She had a slender figure, too,
    And rosy cheeks, and eyes of blue.
    And yet, with all those beauties rare,
    Those angel eyes and curly hair,
    Oh! many, many faults had she,
    The worst of which was jealousy.
    When on the brilliant Christmas tree
    St. Nicholas hung his gifts so free,
    The envious Minnie could not bear
    With any one those gifts to share.
    And when her sisters' birthdays came
    Minnie (it must be told with shame)
    Would envy every pretty thing
    Which dear Mamma to them would bring.

[Illustration]

    Sometimes great tears rolled from her eyes,
    Sometimes she pierced the air with cries,
    For hours together she would fret
    Because their toys she could not get.
    Ah, then! how changed this pretty child,
    No longer amiable and mild.
    That fairy form and smiling face
    Lost all their sprightliness and grace.
    Her tender mother often sighed,
    And to reform her daughter tried.
    "Oh! Minnie, Minnie," she would say,
    "Quite yellow you will turn some day."

[Illustration]

    Now came the merry Christmas feast;
    St. Nicholas brought to e'en the least
    Such pretty presents, rich and rare,
    But all the best for Minnie were.
    Now to her little sister Bess
    St. Nicholas brought a yellow dress;
    This Minnie longed for (envious child),
    And snatched it from her sister mild.
    Then all in tears did Bessie run
    To tell her mother what was done.

[Illustration]

    Then Minnie ran triumphantly
    To try the dress on, as you see.
    But Minnie was not satisfied,
    She pouted, fretted, sulked, and cried;
    Sisters and brothers had no rest,--
    She vowed their presents were the best,
    And springing quickly to the glass,
    What saw she there? Alas! alas!
    Oh! what a sad, such deep disgrace!
    She found she had a yellow face.
    "Ah, me!" she cried, now, in despair,
    "Where are my rosy cheeks--oh, where?"
    Exclaimed her mother, "Now you see
    The punishment of jealousy."

[Illustration]




THE LITTLE GLUTTON


    Oh! how this Mary loved to eat,--
    It was her chief delight;
    She would have something, sour or sweet,
    To munch from morn till night.
    She to the pantry daily stole,
    And slyly she would take
    Sugar, and plums, and sweetmeats, too,
    And apples, nuts, and cake.

[Illustration]

    Her mother Mary oft reproved,
    But, ah! it did no good;
    Munch, nibble, chew, from morn to night,
    The little glutton would.

[Illustration]

    One day, upon some bee-hives near
    She chanced to cast her eyes;
    "How nice that honey there must taste!"
    She cried, and off she flies.
    On tiptoe now the hives she nears,
    Close up to them she creeps,
    And through the little window panes
    Quite cautiously she peeps.
    "Oh, dear! how good it looks!" she cries,
    As she the honey sees;
    "I must, I will, indeed, have some;
    It cannot hurt the bees."
    And then a hive she gently lifts,--
    Oh, foolish, foolish child,--
    Down, down it falls--out swarm the bees
    Buzzing with fury wild.
    With fright she shrieks, and tries to run,
    But ah! 'tis all in vain;
    Upon her light the angry bees,
    And make her writhe with pain.

[Illustration]

    Four weeks and more did Mary lie
    Upon her little bed,
    And, ah! instead of honey, she
    On medicine was fed.
    Her parents grieved so much at first
    Their child so sick to see;
    But once more well, with joy they found
    Her cured of gluttony.

[Illustration]




SOPHIE SPOILALL


    I never saw a girl or boy
    So prone as Sophie to destroy
    Whate'er she laid her hands upon,
    Though tough as wood, or hard as stone;
    With Sophie it was all the same,
    No matter who the thing might claim,
    No matter were it choice or rare,
    For naught did the destroyer care.
    Her playthings shared the common lot;
    Though hers they were, she spared them not,
    Her dolls she oft tore limb from limb,
    To gratify a foolish whim.

[Illustration]

    "Fie!" said her mother, "don't you know,
    That if you use your playthings so,
    Kriss Kringle will in wrath refuse
    To give you what you might abuse?
    Remember, how in times gone by,
    You've always found a rich supply
    Of Christmas presents; but beware,
    You'll find no more another year."

[Illustration]

    You'd think such words would surely tend
    To make this child her ways amend.
    But no; she still her course pursued,
    Regardless of advice so good.
    But when her mother sees 'tis plain
    That all her arguments are vain,
    Says she, "Since I have done my best,
    I'll let experience do the rest."
    Meantime the season of the year
    For Christmas gifts was drawing near,
    And Sophie doubted not that she
    An ample store of them would see.
    At length the happy hour was come.
    The children, led into the room,
    Behold, with wonder and surprise,
    Three tables set before their eyes.
    One is for Nelly, one for Ned,
    And both with choicest treasures spread.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
