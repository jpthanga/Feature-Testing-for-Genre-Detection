[Illustration: POLLY PUT THE KETTLE ON]


[Music:

Polly, put the kettle on,
Polly, put the kettle on,
Polly, put the kettle on,
We'll all have tea.

Sukey, take it off again,
Sukey, take it off again,
Sukey, take it off again,
They've all gone away.]




[Illustration: HOT CROSS BUNS]


[Music:

Hot Cross Buns!
Hot Cross Buns!
One a penny, two a penny,
Hot Cross Buns!
If you have no daughters,
If you have no daughters,
If you have no daughters,
Pray give them to your sons;
But if you have none of these little elves,
Then you must eat them all yourselves.]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THE LITTLE WOMAN AND THE PEDLAR]


[Music:

  There was a little woman, as I've heard say,
      _Fol, lol, diddle, diddle dol;_
  She went to market, her eggs for to sell,
      _Fol, lol, diddle, diddle dol._
  She went to market all on a market day,
  And she fell asleep upon the king's highway;
      _Fol de rol de lol lol lol lol lol,_
      _Fol, lol, diddle, diddle dol._]

2 And there came a pedlar whose name was Stout,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  He cut her petticoats all round about,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  He cut her petticoats up to her knees,
  Which made the little woman to shiver and freeze,
      _Fol de rol, &c._

3 When the little woman began to awake,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  She began to shiver, and she began to shake,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  She began to shake, and she began to cry,
  Lawk-a-mercy on me! this is none of I,
      _Fol de rol, &c._

4 If it be I, as I suppose it be,
      _Fol lol, &c.,_
  I've a little dog at home, and he knows me;
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  If it be I, he will wag his little tail,
  If it be not I, he will bark and rail,
      _Fol de rol, &c._

5 And when the little woman went home in the dark,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  Her little dog he did begin to bark,
      _Fol, lol, &c.,_
  He began to bark, and she began to cry,
  Lawk-a-mercy on me! this is none of I,
      _Fol de rol, &c._




[Illustration: THE LITTLE DISASTER]


[Music:

    Once there lived a little man,
    Where a little river ran,
  And he had a little farm and little dairy O!
    And he had a little plough,
    And a little dappled cow,
  Which he often called his pretty little Fairy O!]

2   And his dog he called Fidelle,
    For he loved his master well;
  And he had a little pony for his pleasure O!
    In a sty not very big
    He'd a frisky little pig,
  Which he often called his little piggy treasure O!

3   Once his little maiden, Ann,
    With her pretty little can,
  Went a-milking when the morning sun was beaming O!
    When she fell, I don't know how,
    But she stumbled o'er the plough,
  And the cow was quite astonished at her screaming O!

4   Little maid cried out in vain,
    While the milk ran o'er the plain,
  Little pig ran grunting after it so gaily O!
    While the little dog behind,
    For a share was much inclined,
  So he pulled back squeaking piggy by the taily O!

5   Such a clatter now began
    As alarmed the little man,
  Who came capering from out his little stable O!
    Pony trod on doggy's toes,
    Doggy snapped at piggy's nose,
  Piggy made as great a noise as he was able O!

6   Then to make the story short,
    Little pony with a snort
  Lifted up his little heels so very clever O!
    And the man he tumbled down,
    And he nearly cracked his crown,
  And this only made the matter worse than ever O!

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THE OLD WOMAN OF NORWICH]


[Music:

There was an old woman and what do you think?
She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;
Victuals and drink were the chief of her diet,
Yet this plaguey old woman could never be quiet.]




[Illustration: THE OLD WOMAN TOSSED UP IN A BLANKET]


[Music:

There was an old woman tossed up in a blanket,
Seventeen times as high as the moon;
Where she was going I could not but ask it,
For in her hand she carried a broom.
"Old woman, old woman, old woman," quoth I;
"O whither, O whither, O whither so high?"
"To sweep the cobwebs from the sky,
And I'll be with you by-and-by!"]




[Illustration: BUY A BROOM]


[Music:

From Deutschland I come with my light wares all laden,
To dear happy England in summer's gay bloom;
Then listen, fair lady, and young pretty mädchen,
Come buy of the wandering Baierin a broom;
A large one for the lady, and a small one for the baby,
Come buy ye, pretty lady, come buy ye a broom.]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: HAUSEGESINDE]


[Music:

  Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne,
  Kannnichtruhn heisst mein Huhn,
  Wedelschwanz heisst meine Gans;
  Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne.]

2 Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne,
  Entequent heisst meine Ent',
  Sammetmatz heisst meine Katz;
  Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne.

3 Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne,
  Schwarz und weiss heisst meine Geiss,
  Schmortöpflein heisst mein Schwein,
  Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne.

4 Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne,
  Ehrenwerth heisst mein Pferd,
  Gute-Muh heisst meine Kuh;
  Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne.

5 Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne,
  Wettermann heisst mein Hahn,
  Kunterbunt heisst mein Hund;
  Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne.

6 Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne,
  Guck-heraus heisst mein Haus,
  Schlupf-heraus heisst mein' Maus;
  Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne.

7 Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne
  Wohlgethan heisst mein Mann,
  Sausewind heisst mein Kind,
  Widewidewenne heisst meine Trut-henne.

_Gesprochen:_
  Nun kennt ihr mich mit Mann und Kind
  Und meinem ganzen Hausgesind.




[Illustration: SCHLAF, KINDLEIN, SCHLAF.]


[Music:

Schlaf, Kindlein, schlaf,
Draussen steht ein Schaf,
Stösst sich an ein em Steinelein,
That ihm weh das Beinelein,
Schlaf, Kindlein, schlaf,
Schlaf, Kindlein, schlaf.]




[Illustration: LITTLE MAN & MAID]


[Music:

    There was a little man
    And he woo'd a little maid,
  And he said, "Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?
    I have little more to say
    Than 'will you, yea or nay?'
  For least said is soonest mended-ded-ded-ded."]

2   The little maid replied,
    (Some say a little sighed,)
  "But what shall we have to eat, eat, eat?
    "Will the love that you're rich in
    "Make a fire in the kitchen?
  "Or the little god of love turn the spit, spit, spit?"

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THE JOLLY TESTER]


[Music:

  O dear Six-pence, I've got Six-pence,
    I love Six-pence as I love my life;
  I'll spend a penny on't, and I'll lend another on't,
    And I'll carry fourpence home to my wife.]

2 O dear Four-pence, I've got Four-pence,
    I love Four-pence as I love my life;
  I'll spend a penny on't, and I'll lend another on't,
    And I'll carry two-pence home to my wife.

3 O dear Two-pence, I've got Two-pence,
    I love Two-pence as I love my life;
  I'll spend a penny on't, and I'll lend a penny on't,
    And I'll carry nothing home to my wife.

4 O dear nothing, I've got nothing,
    What will nothing buy for my wife?
  I have nothing, I spend nothing,
    I love nothing better than my wife.




[Illustration: LUCY LOCKET]


[Music:

Lucy Locket lost her pocket,
Kitty Fisher found it;
But ne'er a penny was there in't,
Except the binding round it.]




[Illustration: IF ALL THE WORLD WERE PAPER]


[Music:

  If all the world were paper,
  And all the sea were ink,
  And all the trees were bread and cheese,
  What should we do for drink?]

2 If all the world were sand--O!
  Oh, then what should we lack--O!
  If, as they say, there were no clay,
  How should we take tobacco?

3 If all our vessels ran-a,
  If none but had a crack,
  If Spanish apes ate all the grapes,
  How should we do for sack?




[Illustration: Ye FAIRY SHIP]


[Music:

  A ship, a ship a-sailing,
    A-sailing on the sea,
  And it was deeply laden
    With pretty things for me;
  There were raisins in the cabin,
    And almonds in the hold;
  The sails were made of satin,
     And the mast it was of gold.]

2 The four-and-twenty sailors
    That stood between the decks,
  Were four-and-twenty white mice
    With rings about their necks.
  The captain was a duck, a duck,
    With a jacket on his back,
  And when this fairy ship set sail,
    The captain he said, "Quack!"




[Illustration: THE LITTLE COCK-SPARROW]


[Music:

  A little cock-sparrow sat on a high tree,
  A little cock-sparrow sat on a high tree,
  A little cock-sparrow sat on a high tree,
  And he chirrupped, he chirrupped so merrily.
  He chirrupped, he chirrupped, he chirrupped, he chirrupped,
  He chirrupped, he chirrupped, he chirrupped, he chirrupped,
  A little cock-sparrow sat on a high tree,
  And he chirrupped, he chirrupped so merrily.]

2 A naughty little boy with a bow and arrow,
  Determined to shoot this little cock-sparrow;

3 For this little cock-sparrow would make a nice stew,
  And his giblets would make a nice little pie too.

4 "Oh, no," says cock-sparrow, "I won't make a stew,"
  And he fluttered his wings, and away he flew.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: THE CARRION CROW]


[Music:

  A carrion crow sat on an oak,
    _Derry, derry, derry, decco;_
  A carrion crow sat on an oak,
  Watching a tailor shaping his cloak.
    _Heigh-ho! the carrion crow,_
    _Derry, derry, derry, decco._]

2 "O wife, bring me my old bent bow,"
     _Derry, derry, derry, decco;_
  "O wife, bring me my old bent bow,
  "That I may shoot yon carrion crow."
     _Heigh-ho! the carrion crow,_
     _Derry, derry, derry, decco._

3 The tailor shot, and he missed his mark,
    _Derry, derry, derry, decco;_
  The tailor shot, and he missed his mark,
  And shot his old sow right through the heart
    _Heigh-ho! the carrion crow,_
    _Derry, derry, derry, decco._

4 "O wife, bring brandy in a spoon,"
    _Derry, derry, derry, decco;_
  "O wife, bring brandy in a spoon,
  "For our old sow is in a swoon."
    _Heigh-ho! the carrion crow,_
    _Derry, derry, derry, decco._




[Illustration: THE SCARECROW]


[Music:

  O all you little blackey tops,
  Pray don't you eat my father's crops,
  While I lie down to take a nap.
      Shua O! Shua O!]

2 If father he perchance should come,
  With his cocked hat and his long gun,
  Then you must fly and I must run.
      Shua O! Shua O!




[Illustration: THE NORTH WIND & THE ROBIN]


[Music:

The north wind doth blow
And we shall have snow,
And what will poor Robin do then--poor thing?
He'll sit in a barn
To keep himself warm,
And hide his head under his wing--poor thing!]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: A B C]


[Music:

  A, B, C, die Katze lief im Schnee,
  Und wie sie wieder 'raus kam,
  Da hatt' sie weisse Stieflein an:
  O jemine, O jemine, O jemine, O je!]

2 A, B, C, die Katze lief zur Hoh',
  Sie lecket ihr kalt Pfötchen rein
  Und putzt sich auch das Stiefelein
  Und ging nicht mehr im Schnee.




[Illustration: ET MOI DE M'EN COURIR]


[Music:

  En passant dans un p'tit bois,
    Où le coucou chantait,
    Où le coucou chantait;
  Dans son joli chant il disait:
  Coucou, coucou, coucou, coucou,
  Et moi qui croyais qu'il disait;
  Cass'-lui le cou, cass'-lui le cou!
  Et moi de m'en cour', cour', cour',
    Et moi de m'en courir!]

2 En passant auprès d'un étang,
    Où les canards chantaient,
    Où les canards chantaient;
  Dans leur joli chant ils disaient:
  "Cancan, cancan, cancan, cancan,"
  Et moi qui croyais qu'ils disaient,
  "Jett'-le dedans, jett'-le dedans,"
  Et moi de m'en cour', cour', cour',
    Et moi de m'en courir!

3 En passant devant une maison,
    Où la bonn' femm' chantait,
    Où la bonn' femm' chantait;
  Dans son joli chant ell' disait:
  "Dodo, dodo, dodo, dodo,"
  Et moi qui croyais qu'elle disait,
  "Cass'-lui les os, cass'-lui les os,"
  Et moi de m'en cour', cour', cour',
    Et moi de m'en courir!




[Illustration: THE OLD MAN IN LEATHER]


[Music:

One misty, moisty morning, when cloudy was the weather,
There I met an old man clothed all in leather, clothed all in leather,
With cap under his chin,
How do you do, how do you do, how do you do, again, again.]

[Illustration]




[Illustration: AIKEN DRUM]


[Music:


 1 There was a man lived in the moon, lived in the moon,
     lived in the moon,
   There was a man lived in the moon,
   And his name was Aiken Drum,
   And he played upon a ladle, a ladle, a ladle,
   And he played upon a ladle,
   And his name was Aiken Drum.]

 2 And his hat was made of good cream cheese,
   And his name, &c.

 3 And his coat was made of good roast beef,
   And his name, &c.

 4 And his buttons were made of penny loaves,
   And his name, &c.

 5 His waistcoat was made of crust of pies,
   And his name, &c.

 6 His breeches were made of haggis bags,
   And his name, &c.

 7 There was a man in another town,
   And his name was Willy Wood;
   And he played upon a razor,
   And his name was Willy Wood.

 8 And he ate up all the good cream cheese,
   And his name, &c.

 9 And he ate up all the good roast beef,
   And his name, &c.

10 And he ate up all the penny loaves,
   And his name, &c.

11 And he ate up all the good pie crust,
   And his name, &c.

12 But he choked upon the haggis bags,
   And there was an end of Willy Wood.




[Illustration: BILLY PRINGLE]


[Music:

Billy Pringle had a little pig,
When it was young it was not very big,
When it was old it lived in clover,
Now it's dead and that's all over.
Billy Pringle he lay down and died,
Betty Pringle she lay down and cried,
So there was an end of one, two, and three,
Billy Pringle he, Betty Pringle she, and the piggy wiggy wee.]




[Illustration: SUR LE PONT D'AVIGNON]


[Music:

  Sur le pont d'Avignon,
  Tout le monde y danse, danse;
  Sur le pont d'Avignon,
  Tout le monde y danse en rond.
  Les beaux messieurs font comm' ça,
  Et puis encor' comm' ça:
  Sur le pont d'Avignon,
  Tout le monde y danse, danse,
  Sur le pont d'Avignon,
  Tout le monde y danse en rond.]

2 Les belles dames font comm' ça,
  Et puis encore comm' ça:
  Sur le pont d'Avignon,
  Tout le monde y danse, danse,
  Sur le pont d'Avignon,
  Tout le monde y danse en rond.

3 Et les capucins font comm' ça,
  Et puis encore comm' ça:
  Sur le pont d'Avignon,
  Tout le monde y danse, danse,
  Sur le pont d'Avignon,
  Tout le monde y danse en rond.

[Illustration]




[Illustration: LONDON BRIDGE]


[Music:

  London Bridge is broken down,
    _Dance over my Ladye Lea;_
  London Bridge is broken down:
    _With a gay ladye._]

2 How shall we build it up again?
    _Dance over my Ladye Lea;_
  How shall we build it up again?
    _With a gay ladye._

3 Silver and gold will be stole away,
    _Dance over my Ladye Lea;_
  Silver and gold will be stole away:
    _With a gay ladye._

4 Iron and steel will bend and bow,
    _Dance over my Ladye Lea;_
  Iron and steel will bend and bow:
    _With a gay ladye._

5 Wood and clay will wash away,
    _Dance over my Ladye Lea;_
  Wood and clay will wash away:
    _With a gay ladye._

6 Build it up with stone so strong,
    _Dance over my Ladye Lea;_
  Huzza! 'twill last for ages long.
    _With a gay ladye._




[Illustration: CHARLEY OVER THE WATER]


[Music:

Over the water, and over the lea,
  And over the water to Charley;
And Charley loves good ale and wine,
  And Charley loves good brandy,
And Charley loves a pretty girl
  As sweet as sugar candy.]

2 Over the water and over the sea,
  And over the water to Charley;
I'll have none of your nasty beef,
  Nor I'll have none of your barley.
But I'll have some of your very best flour
  To make a white cake for my Charley.




[Illustration: THE FOUR PRESENTS]


[Music:

  I had four brothers over the sea,
  _Perrie, Merrie, Dixi, Domine;_
  And they each sent a present unto me.
  _Petrum, Partrum, Paradisi, Tempore,_
  _Perrie, Merrie, Dixi, Domine._]

2 The first sent a goose without a bone,
  _Perrie, Merrie, Dixi, Domine;_
  The second sent a cherry without a stone,
  _Petrum, Partrum, Paradisi, Tempore,_
  _Perrie, Merrie, Dixi, Domine._

3 The third sent a blanket without a thread,
  _Perrie, Merrie, Dixi, Domine;_
  The fourth sent a book that no man could read,
  _Petrum, Partrum, Paradisi, Tempore,_
  _Perrie, Merrie, Dixi, Domine._

4 When the cherry's in the blossom, there is no stone,
  _Perrie, Merrie, Dixi, Domine;_
  When the goose is in the egg-shell, there is no bone.
  _Petrum, Partrum, Paradisi, Tempore,_
  _Perrie, Merrie, Dixi, Domine._

5 When the wool's on the sheep's back, there's no thread,
  _Perrie, Merrie, Dixi, Domine:_
  When the book's in the press, no man can read
  _Petrum, Partrum, Paradisi, Tempore,_
  _Perrie, Merrie, Dixi, Domine._

[Illustration: THE THREE LITTLE KITTENS]


[Music:

  There were three little kittens
  Put on their mittens
  To eat some Christmas pie.
    _Mew, mew,_
    _Mew, mew,_
    _Mew, mew, mew._]

2 These three little kittens
  They lost their mittens,
  And all began to cry.
    _Mew, mew, &c._

3 "Go, go, naughty kittens,
  And find your mittens,
  Or you shan't have any pie."
    _Mew, mew, &c._

4 These three little kittens
  They found their mittens,
  And joyfully they did cry.
    _Mew, mew, &c._

5 "O Granny, dear!
  Our mittens are here,
  Make haste and cut up the pie!"
    _Purr-rr, purr-rr, purr-rr-rr._




[Illustration: PUSSY-CAT]


[Music:

  Pussy-cat high, Pussy-cat low,
  Pussy-cat was a fine teazer of tow.]

2 Pussy-cat she came into the barn,
  With her bag-pipes under her arm.

3 And then she told a tale to me,
  How Mousey had married a humble bee.

4 Then was I ever so glad,
  That Mousey had married so clever a lad.




[Illustration: ZWEI HASEN]


[Music:

  Zwischen Berg und tiefen, tiefen Thal,
  Sassen einst zwei Hasen,
  Frassen ab das grüne, grüne Gras,
  Frassen ab das grüne, grüne Gras
  Bis auf den Rasen,
  Bis auf den Rasen.]

2 Als sie satt gefressen, 'fressen war'n
  Setzten sie sich nieder,
  Bis nun dann der Jäger, Jäger kam,
  Und schoss sie nieder, und schoss sie nieder,

3 Als sie sich nun angesammelt hatt'n
  Und sich besannen,
  Dass sie noch Leben, Leben hatt'n
  Liefen sie von dannen.




[Illustration: RINGEL TANZ]


[Music:

Es regnet auf der Brücke, und ich werd' nass.
Ich hab' noch was vergessen, und weiss nicht was?

Schöne Jungfer hübsch und fein
Komm mit mir zum Tanz herein,
Lass uns einmal tanzen und lustig sein.]




[Illustration: LA BERGÈRE]


[Music:

    Il était un' bergère,
  Et ron, ron, ron, petit patapon;
    Il était un' bergère,
    Qui gardait ses moutons,
      Ron, ron,
    Qui gardait ses moutons.]

2   Elle fit un fromage,
  Et ron, ron, ron, petit patapon;
    Elle fit un fromage
    Du lait de ses moutons,
      Ron, ron,
    De lait de ses moutons.

3   Le chat qui la regarde,
  Et ron, ron, ron, petit patapon;
    Le chat qui la regarde
    D'un petit air fripon,
      Ron, ron,
    D'un petit air fripon.

4   Si tu y mets la patte
  Et ron, ron, ron, petit patapon,
    Si tu y mets la patte
    Tu auras du bâton,
      Ron, ron,
    Tu auras du bâton.

5   Il n'y mit pas la patte,
  Et ron, ron, ron, petit patapon;

      Ron, ron,
    Il y mit le menton.

[Music:

  Il était un petit homm',
  A cheval sur un bâton;
  Il s'en allait à la chass',
  A la chass' aux hannetons,
      Et ti ton, tain', et ti ton tain',
      Et ti ton tain' et ti ton ton.]

2 Il s'en allait à la chass',
  A la chass' aux hannetons;
  Quand il fut sur la montagn',
  Il partit un coup d'canon.
      Et ti, &c.

3 Quand il fut sur la montagn'
  Il partit un coup d'canon;
  Il en eut si peur tout d'mêm',
  Qu'il tomba sur ses talons.
      Et ti, &c.

4 Il en eut si peur tout d'mêm'
  Qu'il tomba sur ses talons;
  Tout's les dames du villag'
  Lui portèrent des bonbons.
      Et ti, &c.

5 Tout's les dames du villag'
  Lui portèrent des bonbons;
  Je vous remerci', mesdam's,
  De vous et de vos bonbons.
      Et ti, &c.




[Illustration: GEFUNDEN]


[Music:

  Ich ging im Walde,
    So für mich hin,
  Und nichts zu suchen
    Das war mein Sinn.]

2 Im Schatten sah ich
    Ein Blümlein stehn,
  Wie Sterne leuchtend,
    Wie Aeuglein schön.

3 Ich wollt' es brechen
    Da sagt es fein:
  "Soll ich zum Welken
    "Gebrochen sein?"

4 Ich grub's mit allen
    Den Würzlein aus,
  Zum Garten trug ich's
    Am hübschen Haus.

5 Und pflanzt es wieder
    Am stillen Ort;
  Nun zweigt es immer
    Und blüht so fort.--(_Goethe._)

[Illustration: LOOBY LIGHT]


[Music:

Now we dance looby, looby, looby,
Now we dance looby, looby light;
Now we dance looby, looby, looby,
Now we dance looby as yesternight.
Shake your right hand a little,
Shake your left hand a little,
Shake your head a little,
And turn you round about.]




[Illustration: MARGERY DAW]


[Music:

See-saw, Margery Daw
Sold her bed to lie upon straw;
Wasn't she a nasty slut
To sell her bed and lie upon dirt?]




[Illustration: THE FLY & THE HUMBLE BEE]


[Music:

  Fiddle-de-dee, Fiddle-de-dee,
    The fly has married the humble bee.
  Says the fly, says he,
    "Will you marry me,
  And live with me,
    Sweet humble bee?"]

2 Says the bee, says she,
    "I'll live under your wing,
  "And you'll never know
    "That I carry a sting."
      Fiddle-de-dee, &c.

3 So when the parson
    Had joined the pair,
  They both went out
    To take the air,
      Fiddle-de-dee, &c.

4 And the flies did buzz,
    And the bells did ring--
  Did ever you hear
    So merry a thing?
      Fiddle-de-dee, &c.

5 And then to think
    That of all the flies
  The humble bee
    Should carry the prize.
      Fiddle-de-dee, &c.

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
