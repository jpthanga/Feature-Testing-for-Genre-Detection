INTRODUCTION


The baculum is the bony part of the penis. In the species of the
subgenus _Neotamias_ the proximal part of the baculum is termed the
shaft, and the distal upturned part is termed the tip. On the dorsal
side of the tip there is a longitudinal ridge termed the keel. The
proximal end of the shaft is termed the base (see fig. 19). Depending on
the species, the shaft varies from 2.11 to 5.28 mm. in length, and the
base may or may not be widened or deepened.

The purpose of this report is to: (1) Show the usefulness of the
structure of the baculum as a taxonomic character in chipmunks; and (2)
compare a classification based on the structure of the baculum with a
classification based on the structure and appearance of the skull and
skin.




METHODS, MATERIALS, AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS


    The bacula which were borrowed from the University of Michigan,
    Museum of Zoology, were processed according to the method
    described by Friley (1947:395-397), whereas all others were
    processed according to the method described by White (1951:125).
    Thus the bacula that were borrowed from the University of
    Michigan, are maintained there in a separate collection, whereas
    the bacula borrowed from other museums and those that are at the
    University of Kansas, Museum of Natural History, are housed with
    the skulls of the corresponding specimens.

    All measurements of the bacula were made by means of an eyepiece
    micrometer.

    A total of 194 bacula were seen. All of these are in the Museum
    of Natural History of the University of Kansas, unless otherwise
    indicated by the following symbols:

    I am grateful to Professor E. Raymond Hall for guidance in my
    study and thank Drs. Robert W. Wilson, Keith R. Kelson, and
    Edwin C. Galbraith, as well as other friends and associates of
    the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, for
    encouragement and valuable suggestions. Dr. William L. Jellison,
    United States Public Health Service, aided me in part of my
    field work and kindly sent me some specimens of chipmunks. My
    wife, Alice M. White, made the illustrations and helped me in
    many ways.

    For the loan of bacula I thank Dr. William H. Burt, University
    of Michigan, Museum of Zoology. For permission to search for
    bacula on study skins, and to process those that were found, I
    thank Miss Viola S. Schantz, United States Fish and Wildlife
    Service, Mr. Colin C. Sanborn, Chicago Natural History Museum,
    Mr. Kenneth E. Stager, Los Angeles County Museum, Dr. David H.
    Johnson, United States National Museum, and Dr. Stephen D.

    University Endowment Association, the National Science
    Foundation and the United States Navy, Office of Naval Research,
    through contract No. NR 161 791.




VARIATION


_Individual variation._--Individual variation is small. This is shown by
a coefficient of variability of only 3.85 in the length of the shaft in
a series of 12 specimens of _E. umbrinus umbrinus_ from Paradise Park,
21 mi. W and 15 mi. N Vernal, 10,050 ft., Uintah County, Utah.

_Variation with age._--In the chipmunks the baculum varies but little
with age. In the youngest specimens that I have taken, the M3 and m3
have not yet erupted and there is no wear on P4 and p4; nevertheless,
the baculum in these specimens has nearly an adult configuration and
size. In juvenal _Eutamias minimus_ the tip of the baculum is longer in
relation to the length of the shaft than it is in adults; the tip is 18
to 28 per cent of the length of the shaft in adults, as opposed to 29 to
32 per cent in juveniles.

_Aberrations._--In a small percentage of specimens of _E. minimus_ and
_E. umbrinus_ the baculum is small and S-shaped, even in adults.

_Variations of taxonomic worth._--Variations in this category are
described in the section immediately following the key.

not dorsoventrally thickened; from _E. amoenus_, _E. minimus_, and _E.
dorsalis_, in keel lower, angle formed by tip and shaft more distinct;
from _E. merriami_, in baculum markedly shorter, base not incised
dorsally.

    _Specimen examined_: One from Big Cottonwood Meadows, S of Mount
    Whitney, 10,000 ft., Inyo Co., California (CN).


#Eutamias minimus# (Bachman)

Figure 2

    Coloration varying from light to dark depending on subspecies;
    size small to medium; rostrum short and stout.

Baculum: Shaft thin; keel low, 1/5 of length of tip; tip 18 to 28 per
cent of length of shaft; angle formed by tip and shaft 125°; distal 1/2
of shaft slightly compressed laterally; shaft short to long, 2.44 to
4.35 mm.

Differs from _E. speciosus_, _E. panamintinus_, _E. umbrinus_, _E.
palmeri_, and _E. bulleri_, in shaft thinner, base not markedly widened;
from _E. quadrivittatus_, _E. ruficaudus_, _E. cinereicollis_, and _E.
quadrimaculatus_, in shaft thinner, tip shorter; from _E. amoenus_, in
tip less than 28 per cent of length of shaft; from _E. dorsalis_, in
angle formed by tip and shaft smaller; from _E. townsendii_, in tip less
than 28 per cent of length of shaft, angle formed by tip and shaft 125°
instead of 130°; from _E. sonomae_, in ridges on either side of tip less
well-developed, keel higher; from _E. merriami_, in shaft shorter (less
than 4.40 mm.), base not incised, tip proportionally longer.

For comparison with _E. alpinus_ see the account of that species.

In most places where _E. minimus_ and _E. amoenus_ occur together they
can be distinguished without recourse to the baculum, but at Banff and
Canmore in western Alberta, recourse to the baculum is almost necessary.
There, as elsewhere, they can be distinguished readily by the shape of
the bacula.

Bacula of _E. q. hopiensis_ from northeastern Arizona are like those in
typical _E. q. quadrivittatus_. The specimens from this region, to judge
from parts of the animal other than the baculum, are intergrades between
_E. q. hopiensis_ and _E. q. quadrivittatus_. Specimens from near Moab,
Grand Co., Utah, are typical _E. q. hopiensis_ and the bacula of these
specimens are considerably smaller than those of specimens of typical
_E. q. quadrivittatus_. No bacula are known to me that are structurally
intermediate between those of _E. q. quadrivittatus_ and _E. q.
hopiensis_.

from _E. quadrimaculatus_, in tip proportionally longer, shaft usually
shorter; from _E. speciosus_, _E. panamintinus_, _E. umbrinus_, _E.

quadrivittatus_, see the accounts of those species.

Baculum of _E. r. simulans_: Shaft thick; keel proportionally low, 2/5
of length of tip; tip 40 to 48 per cent of length of shaft; angle formed
by tip and shaft 130°; distal 2/5 of shaft laterally compressed; base
slightly wider than shaft; shaft medium to long, 3.30 to 4.26 mm.

Differs from _E. cinereicollis_ in, keel proportionally higher, shaft
shorter, tip proportionally longer, angle formed by tip and shaft
smaller, distal 2/5 of shaft more laterally compressed; from _E.
quadrimaculatus_ in, keel proportionally higher, angle formed by tip and

sonomae_, _E. amoenus_, _E. dorsalis_, _E. merriami_, and _E.
quadrivittatus_, see the accounts of those species.

The differences between the bacula of the subspecies _Eutamias
ruficaudus ruficaudus_ and _E. r. simulans_ are comparable to those
usually found between species of chipmunks. Consequently, I suspect that
_E. r. simulans_ and _E. r. ruficaudus_ are specifically distinct and
suggest that a search would be worth while for specimens in the
geographic area between the geographic ranges as now known for the two
kinds to ascertain whether intergradation (the criterion of subspecies)
occurs. I suppose there is no intergradation but in the absence of
precise information, I choose not to modify the current taxonomic
arrangement of _E. r. ruficaudus_ and _E. r. simulans_.

Specimens of _E. umbrinus montanus_ from north-central Colorado have, in
the past (Howell 1929:82), been referred to _E. quadrivittatus
quadrivittatus_. In many features these two kinds of chipmunks resemble
each other closely; their bacula, nevertheless, differ markedly (compare
figs. 8-9 with 17-18).

#Eutamias palmeri# Merriam

Figures 17-18

    General tone of upper parts grayish tawny; ocular stripe pale;
    skull, rostrum, nasals, and upper incisors shorter than in _E.
    umbrinus_.

Baculum: Indistinguishable from that of _E. umbrinus_. This supports the
opinion of previous students that _E. palmeri_ is a close relative of
_E. umbrinus_ which occurs immediately to the north and east.
Intergradation does not occur between these two species, for, low-lying
terrain, inhospitable to chipmunks, isolates _E. palmeri_ from its
relatives. (Verbal information from E. R. Hall.)

    _Specimen examined_: One from Charleston Peak, 8,000 ft., Clear
    Creek Co., Nevada.


#Eutamias bulleri# (J. A. Allen)

Figure 19

    General tone of upper parts dark; dorsal dark stripes
    conspicuous and black; size large; skull large.

length of tip; tip 40 to 48 per cent of length of shaft; angle formed by
tip and shaft 100°; base markedly widened; shaft of medium length, 3.30
mm.

For comparisons with all other species of chipmunks of western North
America, see the accounts of those species.

The large size of the keel of the baculum in this species is distinctive
among chipmunks of western North America.

DISCUSSION


In California, Johnson (1943) recognized ten species of chipmunks and
assigned these to the five main groups of species which were proposed by
Howell (1929). In characterizing each species, Johnson (_op. cit._) not
only made a careful study of skins and skulls, but also employed many
ecological data.

Study of the bacula of the Californian chipmunks supports Johnson's
(_op. cit._) conclusion that there are ten species, but suggests that
there are three (not five) groups of species in California--as well as
elsewhere within the geographic range of the subgenus _Neotamias_. The
three groups are (see figs. 1-19): 1. _minimus_-group (_E. alpinus_, _E.
minimus_, _E. townsendii_, _E. sonomae_, _E. amoenus_, _E. dorsalis_,
and _E. merriami_); 2. _quadrivittatus_-group (_E. quadrivittatus_, _E.
ruficaudus_, _E. cinereicollis_, and _E. quadrimaculatus_); and 3.
_speciosus_-group (_E. speciosus_, _E. panamintinus_, _E. umbrinus_, _E.
palmeri_, and _E. bulleri_).

_Eutamias panamintinus_, according to Howell (_op. cit._:78) and Johnson
(_op. cit._:83), is a near relative of _E. amoenus_. But, the baculum in
_E. panamintinus_ more closely resembles that in _E. speciosus_ than
that in _E. amoenus_ (compare figs. 5, 15, and 16). Consequently I have
placed _E. panamintinus_ in the _speciosus_-group.

In north-central Colorado, specimens that really are _E. umbrinus_
(subspecies _montanus_) have, in the past (Howell _op. cit._:82), been
referred to _E. quadrivittatus quadrivittatus_, but the bacula of the
two species differ markedly from each other (compare figs. 8-9 with
17-18) and permit the specimens readily to be correctly identified to
species. Further, Howell (_op. cit._:95) placed _E. umbrinus_
(subspecies _umbrinus_ and _fremonti_ of current usage) in the
_quadrivittatus_-group, whereas the structure of the baculum leads me to
place _E. umbrinus_ in the _speciosus_-group.

Thus, groups of species established on the basis of only skulls and
skins, in a few instances differ from those established on a broader
basis which includes the bacula.

Johnson (_op. cit._:63) writes, "Each species [of Eutamias] has a
characteristic habitat which differs from those of other species. Where
two or more species occur together in a general locality they are
usually mutually exclusive in their choice of foraging and nesting sites
and in the time of breeding." Thus he classified the species of
Californian chipmunks not only by morphologic characteristics but by
habits and habitats as well. The characteristics of the skulls and skins
of chipmunks probably reflect the habitats in which these animals live.
The characteristics of the bacula, on the other hand, may also reflect
the habitats in which the animals live, but to a lesser degree. Because
the structures of the bacula are probably less affected by the action of
the external environment they probably indicate relationships between
groups of species of chipmunks more clearly than do characteristics of
the skulls and skins.

If the structures of the bacula indicate relationships between groups of
species of chipmunks more clearly than do the characteristics of the
skulls and skins, the close resemblance of the skulls of _E.
quadrivittatus_ and _E. umbrinus_ may be thought of as convergence. The
same can be said of _E. amoenus_ and _E. panamintinus_.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
