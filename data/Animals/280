Geographic Distribution of the Pocket Mouse, Perognathus fasciatus

BY

J. KNOX JONES, JR.


In his "Revision of the pocket mice of the genus Perognathus," Osgood
(1900:18-20) reviewed the distribution, as then known, of _Perognathus
fasciatus_ and recognized two geographic races--_Perognathus fasciatus_
[_fasciatus_] Wied-Neuwied in eastern Montana and Wyoming and adjacent
parts of North and South Dakota, and _Perognathus fasciatus infraluteus_
Thomas, known only from the type locality at Loveland, Larimer County,
Colorado. Later, Cary (1911:61) described _Perognathus fasciatus litus_
as a pale subspecies occurring in the lower Sweetwater Valley and
adjacent parts of the Red Desert of south-central Wyoming. After 1911 no
important taxonomic contributions dealing with _Perognathus fasciatus_
appeared.

In studying the kinds of pocket mice known from Nebraska, I examined
thirteen specimens of _P. fasciatus_ from the northwestern part of the
state which did not agree satisfactorily with the descriptions of any
known subspecies of _fasciatus_. This impelled me to examine material
from the entire range of _P. fasciatus_. This examination revealed that:
(1) _Perognathus callistus_ Osgood, heretofore considered to be a full
species, should be reduced to subspecific rank under _P. fasciatus_; and
(2) specimens from eastern Wyoming and adjacent parts of Montana, South
Dakota and Nebraska represent an heretofore unrecognized subspecies.
Further investigation, however, revealed that _Perognathus flavescens
olivaceogriseus_ Swenk, described from northwestern Nebraska (Swenk,
1940:6), is not _flavescens_ but actually _fasciatus_. Since the
specimens on which Swenk's description was based were taken within the
range of this newly recognized subspecies, and since my examination of
the holotype shows it to be of the species _Perognathus fasciatus_, the
subspecific name _olivaceogriseus_ is available.

The subspecies of _P. fasciatus_ are most easily distinguished by color
of pelage, in which there is a general cline from northeast (dark) to
southwest (pale). Cranially, the subspecies are less distinct. The
skulls of _P. f. callistus_ can be distinguished from those of the other
subspecies by several differences; however, among the other four
subspecies, only minor cranial differences are evident. Individual
variation was found to be greater than secondary sexual variation.

=Perognathus fasciatus fasciatus= Wied-Neuwied

     _Perognathus fasciatus_ Wied-Neuwied, Nova Acta Phys.-Med. Acad.
         Caesar. Leop.-Carol., 19:369, 1839, type from Upper Missouri
         River near its junction with the Yellowstone, near Buford,
         Williams County, North Dakota.

     _Geographic distribution._--Southwestern Manitoba, extreme
     northeastern Montana and all of North Dakota except extreme eastern
     part, south through central South Dakota to the northeastern part
     of Cherry County, Nebraska (see Figure 1).

_Remarks._--For comparisons with _Perognathus fasciatus
olivaceogriseus_, geographically adjacent to the southwest, see account
of that subspecies.

Specimens from the eastern part of the range of _P. f. fasciatus_ are
somewhat smaller and slightly darker than topotypes from Buford, North
Dakota. Specimens from 9 mi. SE Bainville, Johnson Lake and 3 mi. S
Medicine Lake, Montana, and from Crosby, North Dakota, are also paler
than those from farther east. At the southern limit of the range of the
subspecies, specimens from the Rosebud Agency and Minichaduza River,
South Dakota, approach _olivaceogriseus_ in pale dorsal coloration.

=Perognathus fasciatus olivaceogriseus= Swenk

     _Perognathus flavescens olivaceogriseus_ Swenk, Missouri Valley
         Fauna, 3:6, June 5, 1940, type from [Little Bordeaux Creek,
         sec. 14, T. 33 N, R. 48 W, 3 mi. E] Chadron, Dawes County,
         Nebraska.

     _Geographic distribution._--Southeastern Alberta, southeast to
     eastern Wyoming and adjacent parts of South Dakota and Nebraska.

     _Diagnosis._--External measurements of the holotype and average and
     extreme external measurements of six adults (five males and one
     female) from several localities in eastern Wyoming are,
     respectively, as follows: Total length, 124, 132 (125-140); length
     of tail-vertebrae, 53, 63 (59-68); length of hind foot, 16.5, 17
     (17-18); length of ear, 6.5, 6.6 (6.0-7.0). Color: Upper parts
     Cream Buff, lined with black and giving a pale olivaceous
     appearance; lateral line near (16'd) Light Ochraceous-Buff;
     postauricular patches Cream Buff; subauricular patches and
     underparts white; tail indistinctly bicolor, dusky above, whitish
     below. Skull: Size medium for species (see Table 1); braincase and
     auditory bullae moderately inflated; interorbital region narrow;
     mastoidal region broad.

_Remarks._--From topotypes of _Perognathus fasciatus fasciatus_,
geographically adjacent to the northeast, _P. f. olivaceogriseus_
differs in: Upper parts paler, especially face which is heavily washed
with buff; hind foot smaller; skull averaging slightly smaller in all
measurements taken (especially least interorbital breadth and cranial
depth), except mastoidal breadth which is slightly more and
interparietal breadth, length of tympanic bulla and length of maxillary
tooth-row which are approximately the same. From topotypes of
_Perognathus fasciatus infraluteus_, geographically adjacent to the
south, _P. f. olivaceogriseus_ differs in: Upper parts paler and less
drab; lateral line brighter and more ochraceous; underparts never buffy;
skull averaging larger in all measurements taken except interparietal
breadth and length of maxillary tooth-row which are smaller. From
topotypes of _Perognathus fasciatus litus_, geographically adjacent to
the southwest, _P. f. olivaceogriseus_ differs in: Upper parts darker;
skull, when specimens of equal age are compared, averaging larger in
mastoidal breadth, interparietal breadth and basal length. From
topotypes of _Perognathus fasciatus callistus_, _P. f. olivaceogriseus_
differs in: Upper parts slightly darker, pelage not silky, coarser in
appearance; hind foot shorter; skull averaging smaller in all
measurements taken (especially mastoidal breadth), except interparietal
breadth which is more.

Swenk (_loc. cit._) originally described _P. f. olivaceogriseus_ as a
subspecies of _Perognathus flavescens_. I have examined the holotype,
kindly made available to me by Dr. Seth B. Benson of the Museum of
Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, and the paratype, in the
collection of the University of Nebraska State Museum. Neither is _P.
flavescens_, but both are clearly specimens of _P. Fasciatus_ on the
basis of olive-gray dorsal coloration, larger over-all dimensions of the
skull, and in that the tympanic bullae do not meet anteriorly. In
addition, a third specimen from Glen, Nebraska, purported by Swenk to be
intermediate between _flavescens_ and _olivaceogriseus_, has been
examined and found to be an immature _fasciatus_.

[Illustration: FIGS. 2-7. Skulls of two species of pocket mice. All ×
1-1/2. In comparison with _P. flavescens_ note that _P. fasciatus_ has
the tympanic bullae separated anteriorly and that the skull is slightly
larger in over-all dimensions.

FIGS. 2-4. _Perognathus fasciatus fasciatus_. Buford, Williams County,
North Dakota, May 6, 1910, [** Male], No. 168599 USBS.

FIGS. 5-7. _Perognathus flavescens flavescens_, Kennedy, Cherry County,
Nebraska, July 9, 1935, [** Female], No. 66883 MVZ.]

In the original description Swenk indicated the type locality as
Chadron, Dawes County, Nebraska. The locality given on the specimen
label of the holotype, however, is 5 mi. E Chadron. In addition, Swenk
(_loc. cit._), in the paragraph preceding the description of
_olivaceogriseus_, states that the holotype was actually taken on Little
Bordeaux Creek, sec. 14, T. 33 N, R. 48 W, 3 mi. E Chadron, on the farm
of L. M. Gates, who obtained the holotype. It seems best to restrict the
type locality to the place last mentioned.

Four specimens from southeastern Alberta recently reported by Moore
(1953:143) have been examined and seem best referred, among known
subspecies of _fasciatus_, to _P. f. olivaceogriseus_. They differ from
the latter in several minor cranial features and more drab back, sides
and lateral line. When adequate material is available they may prove to
be subspecifically different from _olivaceogriseus_. Moore referred
these specimens to _P. f. fasciatus_.

Specimens from extreme northwestern Nebraska, including the holotype,
are slightly darker than specimens from eastern Wyoming. A specimen from
Ft. Steele, Wyoming, shows approach to _P. f. litus_ in pale dorsal
coloration.

     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 59, as follows: ALBERTA:

=Perognathus fasciatus infraluteus= Thomas

     _Perognathus infraluteus_ Thomas, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6,
         11:406, May, 1893, type from Loveland, Larimer County,
         Colorado.

     _Perognathus fasciatus infraluteus_, Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 18:19,
         September 20, 1900.

     _Geographic distribution._--Known only from the type locality and
     from 7 mi. N Ramah, Colorado. Probably in other parts of
     northeastern Colorado (see Figure 1).

_Remarks._--For comparisons with _Perognathus fasciatus olivaceogriseus_
Swenk, geographically adjacent to the north, see the preceding account
of that subspecies on page 520.

Of the seven topotypes available to me, six show various degrees of
encroachment of the color of the lateral line upon the underparts,
giving the ventral surface a buffy appearance, the "distinguishing
character" of the subspecies according to Osgood (_op. cit._:20). When
additional specimens are available, this character may be found to be
one of individual variation, although no specimens from other parts of
the range of the species have been found to exhibit it. Of the
subspecies _P. f. infraluteus_, each of the eight specimens examined by
me possesses buffy subauricular patches.

The specimen from 7 mi. N Ramah, Colorado, is slightly darker and less
drab than the topotypes and does not possess buffy underparts. The skull
of the specimen is broken but on the basis of characters of the pelage
it seems to be intermediate between _infraluteus_ and _olivaceogriseus_
and is referred to the former on geographic grounds.

     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 8, as follows: COLORADO:
     _Elbert County_: 7 mi. N Ramah, 1 (MZ). _Larimer County_: Loveland,
     7 (USBS).


=Perognathus fasciatus litus= Cary

     _Perognathus fasciatus litus_ Cary, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., 24:61,
         March 22, 1911, type from Sun, Sweetwater Valley, Natrona
         County, Wyoming.

     _Geographic distribution._--Lower Sweetwater Valley and adjacent
     parts of Red Desert in Carbon, Fremont, Natrona and Sweetwater
     counties, Wyoming (see Figure 1).

_Remarks._--For comparisons with _Perognathus fasciatus
olivaceogriseus_, geographically adjacent to the northeast, see account
of that subspecies. From _Perognathus fasciatus callistus_,
geographically adjacent to the southwest, _P. f. litus_ differs in:
Upper parts paler with no trace of olivaceous; hind foot shorter; skull,
when specimens of equal age are compared, averaging smaller in all
measurements taken (especially occipitonasal length, mastoidal breadth,
length of tympanic bulla and cranial depth), except interparietal
breadth which is more.

No fully adult specimens of _P. f. litus_ have been available to me for
this study. Two of the three specimens mentioned by Cary in the original
description (holotype not seen) have been examined and found to possess
adult pelage, but cranially they must be classed as young adults. These
specimens are paler than those of any other subspecies of _fasciatus_
and do not have the olivaceous dorsal coloration present in other
subspecies.

_P. f. litus_ is seemingly an endemic race in the lower Sweetwater
Valley and adjacent parts of the Red Desert, Wyoming. The type locality,
recorded by Cary in the original description as "Sun, Sweetwater Valley,
Wyoming," is here placed in Natrona County on the basis of the map
(frontispiece) in Cary's (1917) "Life Zone Investigations in Wyoming."

     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 9, as follows: WYOMING:
     _Carbon County_: 8 mi. SE Lost Soldier, 6700 ft., 1 (USBS).
     _Fremont County_: Granite Mts., 1 (MZ). _Natrona County_: 5 mi. W
     Independence Rock, 6000 ft., 4 (KU); Sun, 1 (USBS); 16 mi. S, 11
     mi. W Waltman, 6950 ft., 1 (KU). _Sweetwater County_: 27 mi. N
     Table Rock, 1 (MZ).


=Perognathus fasciatus callistus= Osgood

     _Perognathus callistus_ Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 18:28, September
         20, 1900, type from Kinney Ranch, near Bitter Creek, Sweetwater
         County, Wyoming.

     _Geographic distribution._--East of the Green River in central and
     southern parts of Sweetwater County, Wyoming, and adjacent parts of
     Moffat County, Colorado (see Figure 1).

_Remarks._--For comparisons with _Perognathus fasciatus litus_,
geographically adjacent to the north, see account of that subspecies.

When Osgood (_loc. cit._) described _P. f. callistus_ as a full species,
he characterized it as having " ... the attractive coloration of
_fasciatus_, but softer and more delicate. Its position is evidently
between _fasciatus_ and _apache_, and its nearest relations are clearly
with the latter." He further remarked that, "Its large size immediately
separates it from _fasciatus_ which it resembles externally, especially
before maturity."

Comparison of the average and extreme external measurements of ten adult
_P. f. callistus_ from Sweetwater County, Wyoming, with adult
individuals of other subspecies of _P. fasciatus_ shows that _callistus_
does not average larger than _P. f. olivaceogriseus_ except in length of
hind foot and that it averages slightly smaller in all external
measurements than topotypes of _P. f. fasciatus_. Moreover, judging from
the accounts of Goldman (1918:24) and Durrant (1952:235), _Perognathus
apache caryi_ (the subspecies of _P. apache_ nearest to the range of _P.
f. callistus_) is significantly larger externally and has no trace of
olivaceous in the dorsal pelage.

Comparison of the skulls of _callistus_ with a skull of _Perognathus
apache apache_ from Wingate, New Mexico (USBS 137388), reveals the
following differences: Interparietal bone wider in _callistus_,
averaging 4.5 (as opposed to 4.0) and more pentagonal; lacrimal bone
shorter and stouter in _callistus_; tympanic bullae more inflated in
_callistus_; interorbital foramina larger in _callistus_; lower premolar
approximately the same size as the last lower molar in _callistus_,
approximately half the size of the last lower molar in _apache_.
Conversely, comparison of skulls of _callistus_ with those of _P.
fasciatus_ as concerns the above mentioned features reveals that they
closely resemble each other. In view of this resemblance it seems best
to arrange _callistus_ as a subspecies of _P. fasciatus_.

_P. f. callistus_ is distinct cranially from all other subspecies of _P.
fasciatus_ in the narrowness of the interparietal, the greater length of
the tympanic bulla and the greater mastoidal breadth. The fine, silky
nature of the pelage is shared, to some extent, with _P. f. litus_.

A specimen from 27 mi. N, 37 mi. E Rock Springs, Wyoming, referred to
_callistus_ resembles _litus_ in pale dorsal coloration and slightly
wider interparietal. Four immature specimens from 25 mi. N, 38 mi. E
Rock Springs, also referred to _callistus_, have extremely pale juvenal
pelage and also are judged to be intergrades with _litus_.

     _Specimens examined._--Total number, 23, as follows: WYOMING:
     _Sweetwater County_: 18 mi. S Bitter Creek, 6800 ft., 3 (KU);
     Kinney Ranch, 21 mi. S Bitter Creek, 6800 ft., 9 (KU 7, USBS 2); 30
     mi. S Bitter Creek, 2 (KU); 33 mi. S Bitter Creek, 6900 ft., 2
     (KU); 32 mi. S, 22 mi. E Rock Springs, 7025 ft., 2 (KU); 25 mi. N,
     38 mi. E Rock Springs, 6700 ft., 4 (KU); 27 mi. N, 37 mi. E Rock
     Springs, 6700 ft., 1 (KU).

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
