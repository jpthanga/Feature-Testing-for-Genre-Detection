=Article XVI.=--DESCRIPTIONS OF THREE NEW BIRDS FROM THE BELGIAN
CONGO.

BY JAMES P. CHAPIN.


The whole of the large collection of birds secured by the Congo
Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History during the years
1909 to 1915, under the leadership of Mr. Herbert Lang, has now arrived
safely at the Museum. It is composed of material gathered all across the
Belgian Congo, from Boma on the west to Aba in the northeastern corner,
but the greater part from the more remote territory between Stanley
Falls and the Enclave of Lado, including the dense equatorial forests of
the Ituri, Nepoko, and Bomokandi, and the high-grass and bush country of
the Uele District to the north and northeast.

Of the relatively small number of zoölogical expeditions that have
passed through and collected in these regions, none has ever before
been able to make such a prolonged stay, and the varied zoölogical
results of this Expedition are surely of the highest scientific
interest. The ornithological collection contains in the neighborhood
of six thousand skins, and represents some 600 different species, a
number of them of course new to science. These it is our purpose to
describe as promptly as possible in this Bulletin, before taking up
the greater work of a general report on all the forms collected, with
more extended notes on their distribution, habits, food, and nests.

Descriptions of the first three new forms follow:


=Chætura melanopygia= sp. nov.

     Related to _C. stictilæma_, but much larger, with feathers of
     upper breast more heavily margined with blackish, and without any
     trace of a light rump-band.

     Description of type, collector's No. 4986 Congo Exp. A. M. N. H.,
     [Male] ad. Avakubi, Ituri District, Belgian Congo, Aug. 15, 1913.

     Upper parts brownish-black (chætura-black, Ridgw.) becoming black
     on wings and tail, with faint violet and green reflections (green
     on freshly molted feathers). Ear coverts drab, bordered with
     fuscous-black; feathers of throat pale smoke-gray, margined with
     fuscous, those of upper breast similar, but heavily bordered with
     fuscous-black, consequently with a very pronounced "scaly"
     appearance; lower breast growing darker, so that the dark borders
     are less conspicuous, and the feathering of the belly completely
     fuscous-black with slight oily gloss. Under wing coverts
     mouse-gray with darker edges, flanks and under tail-coverts black
     with slight greenish gloss. Tail slightly rounded.

     Iris dark brown, bill black, feet bluish, shading to dusky brown
     on tips of toes and claws. Sexual organs enlarged.

     Length (skin) 145 mm.; wing 164; tail 49.5; bill (exposed
     culmen), 7.5; metatarsus 13.

Only one specimen secured, out of two or three of these swifts that were
flying about over the Ituri River, in company with several examples of
_Chætura cassini_. In spite of our long stay in this region, the species
was not again positively recognized; but _Chætura cassini_, _C.
stictilæma_ and _C. sabinei_ were all of common occurrence there.


=Apaloderma minus= sp. nov.

Resembling _Apaloderma narina_, but decidedly smaller, of different
coloration, and with bill less swollen. The serration of the maxilla
is less pronounced.

The adult male of _A. minus_ is distinguished by the bluer hue of the
forehead, throat, and upper breast, which show in certain lights deep
violet reflections, and by the more scarlet, less crimson color of the
remaining underparts. In life the naked areas on the cheeks are bright
yellow, whereas in _A. narina_ they are light green.

The adult female differs in the more tawny or ochraceous coloration of
the breast, which is grayish in this sex of _A. narina_, although
sometimes washed with light brown on the upper breast. A greenish
gloss on the upper breast is more common in females of _A. narina_.

In juvenal plumage both species are entirely buff below, the feathers
more or less tipped with dusky.

     Type: collector's No. 4983. Congo Exp. A. M. N. H. [Male] ad.
     Avakubi Ituri District, Belgian Congo, August 13, 1913.

     _Description of Adult Male_ (type).--Throat, upper breast, lores
     and forehead glossy wall-green, in certain lights with violet
     reflections; upper tail-coverts much the same, but nape and back
     brilliant peacock-green. Lower breast, sides, belly, and under
     tail-coverts bright scarlet-red; feathering of legs dusky, with
     faint green gloss and slightly bordered with whitish. Primaries
     fuscous-black, the outer ones margined with white and the inner
     ones white at the base. Alula and primary-coverts blackish;
     lesser wing-coverts blackish, broadly margined with green; middle
     coverts with less green and vermiculated with white. Greater
     coverts and secondaries blackish vermiculated with white, the
     former narrowly edged with green, the secondaries only very
     faintly. Three middle pairs of rectrices blackish, slightly
     glossed with violet-blue and margined with green; outer three
     pairs white, with bases black faintly glossed with blue, this
     blackish color extending out furthest on inner webs, and finally
     breaking up into small dusky spots.

     Iris red-brown; distal portion of bill light greenish gray, base
     of bill and two naked patches beneath eye light cadmium-yellow,
     naked skin above eye lemon-yellow; bare skin of foreneck (covered
     in life by plumage) light blue; feet pale pink.

     Length (skin) 254 mm.; length of bill (culmen from base) 18 mm.;
     height of bill at nostril 9.5 mm.; greatest width of maxilla, near
     gape, 16 mm.; wing (measured with dividers) 113 mm.; tail 146 mm.

     In some of the other male specimens the green borders on the
     secondaries are lacking, and the exact intensity of the white
     vermiculation is of course variable. The measurements of a series
     of 11 adult males are: bill, 17-18.5 mm.; wing, 108-115.5; tail,
     136.5-151. This is smaller than any _Apaloderma_ heretofore
     described.

     _Adult Female._ Crown, back, and rump brilliant peacock-green,
     upper tail-coverts viridian. Lores, forehead, and ear-coverts
     more brownish; throat and upper breast snuff-brown, sometimes
     with glossy green at sides of neck or a few narrow green borders
     on the chest. Lower breast cinnamon, sometimes finely barred with
     dusky; belly somewhat lighter and rosier than that of male;
     feathering of legs dusky. Tail similar to that of male; but the
     vermiculation on the wing-coverts and secondaries is very much
     finer, and light ochraceous-buff, not white.

     Iris red-brown; naked cheek-patches lemon-yellow, base of bill
     slightly deeper yellow; culmen dusky, bill light green below;
     feet flesh-color, claws gray.

     Measurements of three adult females: bill (culmen from base),
     17-17.5 mm.; wing 104.5-113 mm.; tail, 140-149 mm.

     An _immature male_ has the green of the upper breast broken by
     irregular bars of cinnamon. The lower breast is cinnamon mixed
     with rose, and barred at the sides with green, and shades to
     light scarlet-red on belly and under tail-coverts. The greater
     wing-coverts and three inner secondaries bear each a large spot
     of light ochraceous buff, extending across the whole width of the
     innermost secondary, and most of the secondaries are vermiculated
     or speckled on their outer webs with buff. Just behind the eye
     there is a small spot of white, and the lower edge of the
     ear-coverts is marked by a buff line.

     Iris dark brown; maxilla dusky, but its base greenish-yellow like
     the naked cheek-patches, mandible light yellowish-green, with
     light-gray tip; feet pinkish. Bill, 18.5 mm.; wing, 108; tail, 139.

     A _nestling_ ([Male]), with tail only 25 mm. long, is of a
     yellower green above (calliste green); lores, forehead and entire
     underparts cinnamon-buff, the downy feathers slightly tipped with
     dusky except on abdomen. The wing-coverts and inner secondaries
     bear large spots of buff. Iris brownish-gray; bill very light
     bluish-gray, its base and corners of mouth greenish-yellow; feet
     pale flesh-color, claws gray.

     The spots on the inner secondaries, in the first plumage, appear
     to be much larger in the case of _A. minus_ than with _A.
     narina_, for an immature female specimen of the latter shows only
     rounded spots on the outer webs not exceeding 5.5 mm. in diameter,
     while the additional buffy speckling is practically absent.

This trogon was found by us in the Ituri forest, from the Nepoko River
south to Avakubi and westward to Banalia, but its range is certainly
wider than this. It is a species perfectly distinct from _Apaloderma
narina_, but both occur in the same forests, though the latter was
also to be heard at times in areas of tall second-growth, whereas _A.
minus_ seemed never to leave the primitive uncut forest, and was
extremely shy and difficult to observe. These two trogons may easily
be recognized by their voices, the common note of _A. narina_ being a
double, dove-like "cu-coo," which is repeated slowly for several
seconds, starting faintly but increasing in strength, and accompanied
by a slight wagging of the tail. That of _A. minus_ is a series of
longer, more mournful sounds that might be represented by the word
"kwaw." These calls are given by the males.

As compared with the measurements given in Prof. Reichenow's "Vögel
Afrikas" and the British Museum Catalogue, our specimens of
_Apaloderma narina_ from the Ituri District seem rather small, and may
belong to the race _æquatoriale_ of Dr. Sharpe.

A series of 12 adult males measures: bill (culmen from base) 18.5-21
mm.; wing 117.5-128; tail 146.5-166. The green borders of the
secondaries are never very well marked, and sometimes virtually absent.

Seven females from the same region measure: Bill, 18.5-21; Wing
117.5-129; Tail, 149-169.

One male collected in the Uele District, in a small forest tract
between Faradje and Aba, is strikingly larger; wing, 134; tail 194.
This example is probably referable to _A. n. narina_.


=Ceriocleptes= gen. nov. (Indicatoridæ).

     Resembling _Indicator_ in its bill and general form, save for the
     tail, which is composed of 12 quills, the two middle pairs of
     nearly equal length, somewhat pointed and curved strongly
     outwards, the next pair considerably shorter, but also pointed
     and slightly curved; while the fourth, fifth and sixth are
     straight, greatly narrowed, and stiffened, becoming successively
     shorter, so that the outermost pair is not half so long as the
     median. The tail-coverts are unusually long, those below as long
     as the longest rectrices, and projecting in the fork of the tail.


=Ceriocleptes xenurus= sp. nov.

     Description of type, collector's No. 5628, Congo Exp. A. M. N. H.
     [Male] ad., Avakubi, Ituri District, Belgian Congo. Apr. 17,
     1914.

     Feathers of forehead, crown, back, and rump blackish-brown,
     bordered or washed with yellowish-citrine, those of nape and
     upper back whitish at the base. Sides of head lighter, shading
     gradually to olive-buff on throat, breast, and sides; middle of
     abdomen still lighter, ivory-yellow. Upper wing-coverts and
     secondaries fuscous-black (freshly molted feathers blacker)
     narrowly edged with olive-ocher. Primaries similar, but yellowish
     border almost entirely lacking; both primaries and secondaries
     fading to pale olive-buff on their inner edges. Under
     wing-coverts colored like the breast, but with faint dusky
     shaft-streaks. Feathering of flanks ivory-yellow, with strong
     blackish median lines. Two middle pairs of rectrices dull
     blackish, 3rd pair whitish, with a small blackish spot on the
     outer edge close to the tip, and a larger concealed black spot on
     the inner web towards the base; the 3 remaining pairs of
     rectrices white. The long median pair of under tail-coverts
     blackish, the next pair similar, but margined with whitish, the
     remainder ivory-yellow with faint shaft-streaks of dark brown.
     Upper tail-coverts fuscous-black, bordered with amber-yellow.[1]

     The bill, nostril, and feet resemble those of _Indicator
     indicator_, but the bill is somewhat stouter, while the wings and
     tail are shorter. The 9th (outer) primary is intermediate in
     length between the 6th and 5th; the 7th and 8th are longest.

     Iris bright brown, naked edges of eyelids grayish-brown; bill
     dusky-brown; feet dull grayish-green.

     Length (skin), 160 mm.; wing, 93.5; tail 56; bill (culmen from
     base), 13.5; metatarsus, 14.

This unique specimen was shot by the describer from a tall tree in the
forest, where it was accompanied by one other of its kind. The sexual
organs were somewhat enlarged; the stomach filled with beeswax, mixed
with small pieces of insects. Apparently this species is not in the
habit of leading men to beehives.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
