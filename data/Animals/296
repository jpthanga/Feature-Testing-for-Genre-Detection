Taxonomic Status of Some Mice of The Peromyscus boylii Group in Eastern
Mexico, With Description of a New Subspecies

BY

TICUL ALVAREZ


Saussure (1860) described _Peromyscus aztecus_ from southern México.
Osgood (1909) by comparison of one of Saussure's specimens with some
from Mirador, Veracruz, concluded that _aztecus_ was a subspecies of _P.
boylii_. Dalquest (1953) incorrectly reported specimens of _P. boylii_
from San Luis Potosí as _P. b. aztecus_. Merriam (1898) named
_Peromyscus levipes_ from Mt. Malinche, Tlaxcala. Thomas (1903)
described from Orizaba, Veracruz, _P. beatae_, which Osgood (1909)
mistakenly thought was indistinguishable from _P. boylii levipes_.
Therefore, Osgood in 1909 in his revision of the genus _Peromyscus_
reported only two subspecies of _P. boylii_ from eastern México: _P. b.
levipes_, and _P. b. aztecus_. Study of Osgood's and Thomas' material,
along with recently collected specimens from the states of eastern
México, leads me to conclude that _P. aztecus_ and _P. boylii_ are
different species; that _P. beatae_ is a valid subspecies different from
_P. b. levipes_; and finally that specimens of _P. boylii_ from Nuevo
León and northwestern Tamaulipas pertain to an hitherto unnamed
subspecies.


#Peromyscus aztecus# Saussure

    1860. _H[esperomys]. aztecus_ Saussure, Revue et Mag. Zool.,
        Paris, ser. 2, 12:105, type from southern México, probably
        from the vicinity of Mirador, Veracruz, according to Osgood
        (N. Amer. Fauna, 28:156-157, April 17, 1909).

    1909. _Peromyscus boylei aztecus_, Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna,
        28:156, April 17.

    _Geographic distribution._--Known only from Mirador and Jalapa
    in Veracruz, and Huachinango in Puebla.

    _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the genus (see measurements); tail
    about as long as head and body; dorsal coloration near Sayal
    Brown (capitalized color terms after Ridgway, 1912); sides
    reddish; underparts Light Buff; tail bicolored but not
    distinctly so; supraorbital border of skull angular, and bullae
    pointed anteriorly; anterior half of braincase nearly straight
    (not rounded) as viewed from above; upper molar series long
    (4.7-5.0); incisive foramina short in relation to length of
    skull.

    _Comparisons._--From _Peromyscus boylii_, _P. aztecus_ differs
    as follows: Larger in most parts measured; maxillary tooth-row
    4.7-5.0 instead of 4.0-4.6; color brighter on sides (reddish
    instead of ochraceous); supraorbital border angular instead of
    rounded; anterior border of zygomatic plate convex in upper half
    and almost straight in lower half as opposed to nearly straight
    throughout in _boylii_; pterygoid fossa broader; bullae more
    pointed anteriorly and less inflated; mesostyles of upper molars
    larger; surface between orbital region and nasals convex in
    lateral view instead of flat.

_Remarks._--When Saussure (1860:105) described _P. aztecus_ he did not
designate a type or type locality. Osgood (1909:157) designated as
lectotype the mounted specimen, in the Geneva Museum, which has the
skull inside and of which Saussure figured the molar teeth. Osgood
(_loc. cit._) examined one of the three specimens (No. 3926 USNM) that
Saussure used in describing _P. aztecus_ and found that it agreed "in
every respect with recently collected specimens from Mirador, Veracruz,
which, in the lack of exact knowledge, may be assumed to be the type
locality, as it is certain that some at least of Saussure's specimens
were taken near there."

[Illustration: FIG. 1. Two species of _Peromyscus_.
    1. _P. boylii ambiguus_
    2. _P. boylii beatae_
    3. _P. boylii levipes_
    4. _P. aztecus_ (triangles)]

Osgood regarded _P. aztecus_ as a subspecies of _P. boylii_ because of
the resemblance between _aztecus_ and _P. b. evides_, but _evides_ is
far removed geographically (occurring only in western México) from
_aztecus_, and is smaller. _P. aztecus_ is larger than any known
subspecies of _P. boylii_, and is not known to intergrade with _P. b.
levipes_ or _P. b. beatae_ (with which _aztecus_ occurs sympatrically at
Jalapa, Veracruz), the two subspecies of _boylii_ that are found nearest
the geographic range of _P. aztecus_. Also, as mentioned previously,
_aztecus_ possesses distinctive characters that distinguish it from all
subspecies of _boylii_. For these reasons I regard _aztecus_ as a
distinct species.

According to Hall and Kelson (1959:634), _P. aztecus_ occurs in San Luis
Potosí, Hidalgo, and west-central Veracruz, but their map 364 is based
on the records of Osgood (1909:158) and Dalquest (1953:143). I have
examined all the specimens reported by the two authors last named and
find that those from San Luis Potosí are _P. boylii levipes_.

The diagnosis and comparisons here presented of _aztecus_ were based on
specimens from Mirador in comparison with all the specimens of _P.
boylii_ from eastern México listed beyond. The largest specimens of _P.
boylii_ that I have examined are from Las Vigas, Veracruz, and
localities within a radius of five kilometers thereof. Some measurements
of these large specimens of _P. boylii_ overlap those of _P. aztecus_
but the two kinds of mice differ greatly in characters of the skull, in
color, and in length of tail.

The specimens (three adults and three juveniles) from Huachinango,
Puebla, are slightly darker than specimens from Mirador but do not
differ otherwise. Of two specimens reported from Jalapa, Veracruz, by
Osgood (1909:158), one (108547 USNM) agrees with specimens from Mirador
in color and cranial characteristics and is _P. aztecus_, whereas the
other (108548 USNM) is _P. b. beatae_.

    _Specimens examined._--Total 16 (all USNM) as follows: PUEBLA:
    Huachinango, 6. VERACRUZ: Mirador, 9; Jalapa, 1.


#Peromyscus boylii levipes# Merriam

    1898. _Peromyscus levipes_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc.
        Washington, 12:123, April 30, type from Mt. Malinche, 8400
        ft., Tlaxcala.

    1909. _Peromyscus boylei levipes_, Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna,
        28:153, April 17.

    _Geographic distribution._--Southeastern Tamaulipas and eastern
    San Luis Potosí, south through the central states of México to
    Guatemala.

    _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the species; tail shorter or
    longer than head and body (83-112.3%); color variable according
    to locality but in general ochraceous, having some dusky on
    upper parts; supraorbital border not angular, almost rounded;
    auditory bullae large.

    _Comparisons._--For comparisons see accounts of the subspecies
    discussed beyond and Osgood (1909:145).

_Remarks._--A precise diagnosis for _P. b. levipes_ is difficult to
prepare because some geographic variation in color and in the cranial
characters is present within the range of the subspecies as here
understood. For instance there is a gradual cline of decreasing size to
the northward in nearly all measurements, but the ratio of length of
tail to length of head and body does not present such a cline; mice
from several localities in San Luis Potosí have a relatively shorter
tail than do mice from farther north and from farther south. Also,
specimens labeled in reference to Zacualpilla, Jacales, Jacala,
Tulancingo, and San Miguel Regla average slightly darker dorsally than
do typotypes. Some of these specimens are reddish on the cheek and
lateral line. Specimens from San Luis Potosí resemble topotypes, but
some specimens from northeastern localities in that state have cinnamon
or brownish upper parts and are intermediate in coloration between
populations of _levipes_ to the south and populations of the same
subspecies to the north from the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra de
Tamaulipas. Specimens from these two sierras have a cinnamon-reddish
color that is more intense in specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas.

Osgood (1909:153) recorded _P. b. levipes_ as occurring from central
Nuevo León south through San Luis Potosí, Hidalgo, and Veracruz to
southern Oaxaca. Actually specimens from Nuevo León and from most parts
of Veracruz differ subspecifically from _levipes_ and also from each
other. In Veracruz, _P. b. levipes_ is known only from the northwestern
part.

    _Specimens examined._--Total 179 as follows: TAMAULIPAS: Sierra
    Madre Oriental, 5 mi. S, 3 mi. W Victoria, 1900 ft., 2; _8 mi.
    S, 6 mi. W Victoria, 4000 ft._, 37; Sierra de Tamaulipas, 2000

    Zacualpilla, 6500 ft._, 5. TLAXCALA: Mt. Malinche, 3 (USNM).


#Peromyscus boylii beatae# Thomas

    1903. _Peromyscus beatae_ Thomas, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7,
        11:485, May, type from Xometla Camp, Mt. Orizaba, Veracruz.

    _Geographic distribution._--East side of the Sierra Madre
    Oriental in Veracruz, from Jalancingo south to Xuchil.

    _Diagnosis._--Size large for the species; tail no shorter than
    head and body (100-114.8%); dorsum dark (near Prout's Brown or
    Mummy Brown middorsally, Clay Color on sides); supraorbital
    border rounded; anterior palatine foramina long.

    _Comparisons._--_P. b. beatae_ differs from other subspecies of
    _P. boylii_ by the combination of large size, long tail, and
    dark color.

_Remarks._--Thomas (1903:485) described _P. beatae_ on the basis of five
specimens from Xometla Camp (lat. 18° 59' N, long. 97° 10' W) and one
juvenile from Santa Barbara Camp, both on the Volcán de Orizaba,
Veracruz. Thomas thought that _beatae_ was related to _aztecus_, but the
differences relied on by him to distinguish the two are the same as
those that distinguish _aztecus_ from _boylii_. Osgood (1909:153) placed
_beatae_ in synonymy under _P. b. levipes_ because Mount Orizaba (type
locality of _beatae_) is "relatively very near" Mount Malinche (type
locality of _levipes_), and Thomas had not compared _beatae_ with
_levipes_. Xometla, on the east side of the Volcán de Orizaba, is
approximately 56 miles east of the Tlaxcalan part of Mount Malinche and
is situated where the Tropical Life-zone begins, whereas Mount Malinche
is in the Austral Life-zone on the Mexican Plateau; the difference in
habitat between the two places is great. Topotypes of _levipes_ differ
from two topotypes of _beatae_ in the same fashion as do other specimens
of _levipes_ (from San Luis Potosí) from other specimens of _beatae_
(from Veracruz). Unfortunately, the topotypes of _beatae_ lack external
measurements and are subadults, but their coloration agrees with that of
other specimens that are here referred to _beatae_.

Hall and Kelson (1959:634, map 364) incorrectly mapped the distribution
of _levipes_ in Veracruz. There are at least two places named Xuchil in
the state of Veracruz and Hall and Kelson (_loc. cit._) unfortunately
plotted the one at lat. 20° 42' N, long. 97° 42' W whereas the specimens
actually were collected at the Xuchil on the pleateau south of the
Volcán de Orizaba (18° 53' N, 97° 14' W) in the west-central part of
Veracruz. The specimens from Xuchil are _P. b. beatae_.

Intergradation in color between the two subspecies _levipes_ and
_beatae_ is seen in specimens from Jalapa and Zacualpan (3 km. N, also
others from 3 km. W), Veracruz. Intergradation between these two
subspecies possibly will be found elsewhere along the Sierra Madre
Oriental.

    _Specimens examined._--Total 60 as follows: VERACRUZ: 1 km. E
    Jalancingo, 6500 ft., 2; _2 km. S Jalancingo_, 2; 6 km. SSE
    Altotonga, 8000 ft., 8; _1 km. W Las Vigas, 8500 ft._, 2; Las
    Vigas, 8500 ft., 13; _2 km. E Las Vigas, 8000 ft._, 5; _3 km. E
    Las Vigas, 8000 ft._, 8; _5 km. E Las Vigas_, 7 (TAM); _5 km. N
    Jalapa, 4500 ft._, 2; _Jalapa_, 1 (USNM); 10 km. SE Perote, N
    slope Cofre de Perote, 10,500 ft., 1 (TAM); Xometla Camp, Mt.
    Orizaba, 8500 ft., 2 (BM); _Sta. Barbara, Mt. Orizaba, 12,000
    ft._, 1 (BM); Xuchil, 6 (CM).


#Peromyscus boylii ambiguus# new subspecies

    _Type._--Male, adult, skin and skull, No. 33092, United States
    National Museum, from Monterrey, Nuevo León; obtained on
    February 17, 1891, by Wm. Lloyd, original number 377.

    _Geographic distribution._--Eastern Coahuila, central Nuevo
    León, and the Sierra San Carlos, Tamaulipas.

    _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; tail averaging longer
    than head and body (90-114%); dorsal coloration ochraceous,
    slightly darker middorsally; cheeks and lateral line Capucine
    Orange; skull small; supraorbital border rounded; anterior
    palatine foramina short.

    _Comparisons._--_P. b. ambiguus_ differs from _P. b. levipes_ in
    smaller size, longer tail relative to length of head and body,
    smaller incisive foramina, brighter and paler color, and
    relatively broader interorbital region. From _P. b. beatae_, _P.
    b. ambiguus_ differs in being smaller in all parts measured and
    paler.

_Remarks._--Osgood (1909:155) reported as _P. b. levipes_ 37 specimens
from Monterrey and 18 from Cerro de la Silla, Nuevo León, but noted that
they were "aberrant." I have examined those same specimens and can
hardly decide to which species, _P. boylii_ or _P. pectoralis_, they
belong. Everything considered I, as did Osgood, opine that the specimens
are _P. boylii_. However, I do not rule out the possibility that in this
area there is an unnamed species, because I find an unusually wide range
of variation in such cranial characters as size of the bullae, width and
form of the pterygoid fossa, and shape of the braincase. Extremes of
these characters are not constantly associated except in one specimen
(33124 USNM), which is the smallest of all the adults examined. It has
small bullae, a short rostrum, widely spreading zygomatic arches
anteriorly, and a narrow pterygoid fossa, but does not differ externally
from the other specimens. Additional material from this area is needed
in order to make out the systematic position of these mice.

Because of the wide range of variation in some of its characters, _P. b.
ambiguus_ is difficult to diagnose. Nevertheless, its small external and
cranial size, short anterior palatine foramina, and bright color seem to
separate it from other subspecies of _P. boylii_ in the eastern part of
the range of the species. These differences are most conspicuous when
specimens from the northernmost part of the range of _levipes_ are
compared with specimens of _ambiguus_.

The specimens from the Sierra San Carlos, Tamaulipas, closely resemble
_levipes_ in color, but are referred to _ambiguus_ on the basis of small
size, as also are the two specimens from 12 km. E San Antonio de las
Alazanas, Coahuila.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
