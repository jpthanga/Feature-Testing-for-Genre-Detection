Book 31        Obadiah

31:001:001 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning
           Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador
           is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up
           against her in battle.

31:001:002 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
           greatly despised.

31:001:003 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that
           dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high;
           that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the
           ground?

31:001:004 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set
           thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith
           the LORD.

31:001:005 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou
           cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if
           the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some
           grapes?

31:001:006 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden
           things sought up!

31:001:007 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the
           border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
           thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have
           laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.

31:001:008 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise
           men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

31:001:009 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end
           that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by
           slaughter.

31:001:010 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover
           thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

31:001:011 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day
           that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and
           foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
           Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.

31:001:012 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother
           in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou
           have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their
           destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the
           day of distress.

31:001:013 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in
           the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked
           on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have
           laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;

31:001:014 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off
           those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have
           delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of
           distress.

31:001:015 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou
           hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return
           upon thine own head.

31:001:016 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the
           heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they
           shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not
           been.

31:001:017 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
           holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their
           possessions.

31:001:018 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of
           Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they
           shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be
           any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken
           it.

31:001:019 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and
           they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the
           fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin
           shall possess Gilead.

31:001:020 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall
           possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the
           captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess
           the cities of the south.

31:001:021 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of
           Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
