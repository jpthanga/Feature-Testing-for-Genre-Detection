Book 35        Habakkuk

35:001:001 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

35:001:002 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry
           out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!

35:001:003 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold
           grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there
           are that raise up strife and contention.

35:001:004 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go
           forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;
           therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.

35:001:005 Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder
           marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will
           not believe, though it be told you.

35:001:006 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty
           nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to
           possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's.

35:001:007 They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their
           dignity shall proceed of themselves.

35:001:008 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more
           fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall
           spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far;
           they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.

35:001:009 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as
           the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the
           sand.

35:001:010 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a
           scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they
           shall heap dust, and take it.

35:001:011 Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and
           offend, imputing this his power unto his god.

35:001:012 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?
           we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for
           judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for
           correction.

35:001:013 Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look
           on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
           treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked
           devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?

35:001:014 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping
           things, that have no ruler over them?

35:001:015 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in
           their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they
           rejoice and are glad.

35:001:016 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto
           their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their
           meat plenteous.

35:001:017 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare
           continually to slay the nations?

35:002:001 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and
           will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall
           answer when I am reproved.

35:002:002 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make
           it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.

35:002:003 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it
           shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it;
           because it will surely come, it will not tarry.

35:002:004 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but
           the just shall live by his faith.

35:002:005 Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man,
           neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and
           is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him
           all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:

35:002:006 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a
           taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that
           increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that
           ladeth himself with thick clay!

35:002:007 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and
           awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto
           them?

35:002:008 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the
           people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the
           violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell
           therein.

35:002:009 Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house,
           that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered
           from the power of evil!

35:002:010 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many
           people, and hast sinned against thy soul.

35:002:011 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of
           the timber shall answer it.

35:002:012 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a
           city by iniquity!

35:002:013 Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall
           labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves
           for very vanity?

35:002:014 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory
           of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

35:002:015 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy
           bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest
           look on their nakedness!

35:002:016 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let
           thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand
           shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on
           thy glory.

35:002:017 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of
           beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and
           for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that
           dwell therein.

35:002:018 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath
           graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the
           maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?

35:002:019 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone,
           Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and
           silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

35:002:020 But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep
           silence before him.

35:003:001 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

35:003:002 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD,
           revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the
           years make known; in wrath remember mercy.

35:003:003 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.
           His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his
           praise.

35:003:004 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out
           of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.

35:003:005 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth
           at his feet.

35:003:006 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder
           the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the
           perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.

35:003:007 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of
           the land of Midian did tremble.

35:003:008 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger
           against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou
           didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?

35:003:009 Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the
           tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with
           rivers.

35:003:010 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of
           the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up
           his hands on high.

35:003:011 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light
           of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy
           glittering spear.

35:003:012 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst
           thresh the heathen in anger.

35:003:013 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
           salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of
           the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto
           the neck. Selah.

35:003:014 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his
           villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their
           rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.

35:003:015 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the
           heap of great waters.

35:003:016 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the
           voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in
           myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he
           cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his
           troops.

35:003:017 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit
           be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the
           fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from
           the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:

35:003:018 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my
           salvation.

35:003:019 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like
           hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high
           places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
