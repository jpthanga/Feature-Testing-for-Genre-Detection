Book 28        Hosea

28:001:001 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri,
           in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of
           Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of
           Israel.

28:001:002 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD
           said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and
           children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great
           whoredom, departing from the LORD.

28:001:003 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
           conceived, and bare him a son.

28:001:004 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
           little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the
           house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the
           house of Israel.

28:001:005 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the
           bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.

28:001:006 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said
           unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have
           mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them
           away.

28:001:007 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save
           them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor
           by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.

28:001:008 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a
           son.

28:001:009 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people,
           and I will not be your God.

28:001:010 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand
           of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it
           shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto
           them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them,
           Ye are the sons of the living God.

28:001:011 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be
           gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they
           shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of
           Jezreel.

28:002:001 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.

28:002:002 Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither
           am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out
           of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;

28:002:003 Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was
           born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry
           land, and slay her with thirst.

28:002:004 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the
           children of whoredoms.

28:002:005 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived
           them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my
           lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my
           flax, mine oil and my drink.

28:002:006 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and
           make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.

28:002:007 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not
           overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find
           them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first
           husband; for then was it better with me than now.

28:002:008 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil,
           and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for
           Baal.

28:002:009 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
           thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover
           my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.

28:002:010 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her
           lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.

28:002:011 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her
           new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

28:002:012 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she
           hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me:
           and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field
           shall eat them.

28:002:013 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she
           burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her
           earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and
           forgat me, saith the LORD.

28:002:014 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
           wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.

28:002:015 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley
           of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in
           the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out
           of the land of Egypt.

28:002:016 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt
           call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.

28:002:017 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and
           they shall no more be remembered by their name.

28:002:018 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the
           beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the
           creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and
           the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them
           to lie down safely.

28:002:019 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth
           thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in
           lovingkindness, and in mercies.

28:002:020 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou
           shalt know the LORD.

28:002:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the
           LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;

28:002:022 And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil;
           and they shall hear Jezreel.

28:002:023 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy
           upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them
           which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall
           say, Thou art my God.

28:003:001 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of
           her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the
           LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods,
           and love flagons of wine.

28:003:002 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an
           homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:

28:003:003 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou
           shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another
           man: so will I also be for thee.

28:003:004 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
           king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and
           without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:

28:003:005 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
           LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD
           and his goodness in the latter days.

28:004:001 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD
           hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because
           there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the
           land.

28:004:002 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and
           committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.

28:004:003 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth
           therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with
           the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be
           taken away.

28:004:004 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are
           as they that strive with the priest.

28:004:005 Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also
           shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy
           mother.

28:004:006 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou
           hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou
           shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law
           of thy God, I will also forget thy children.

28:004:007 As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore
           will I change their glory into shame.

28:004:008 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
           their iniquity.

28:004:009 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will
           punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.

28:004:010 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
           whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off
           to take heed to the LORD.

28:004:011 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.

28:004:012 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff
           declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused
           them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their
           God.

28:004:013 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn
           incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms,
           because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters
           shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.

28:004:014 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom,
           nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are
           separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots:
           therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.

28:004:015 Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah
           offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to
           Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.

28:004:016 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD
           will feed them as a lamb in a large place.

28:004:017 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

28:004:018 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:
           her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.

28:004:019 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be
           ashamed because of their sacrifices.

28:005:001 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and
           give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you,
           because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon
           Tabor.

28:005:002 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I
           have been a rebuker of them all.

28:005:003 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O
           Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.

28:005:004 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for
           the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have
           not known the LORD.

28:005:005 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore
           shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also
           shall fall with them.

28:005:006 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek
           the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn
           himself from them.

28:005:007 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have
           begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with
           their portions.

28:005:008 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry
           aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.

28:005:009 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the
           tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.

28:005:010 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
           therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.

28:005:011 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he
           willingly walked after the commandment.

28:005:012 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house
           of Judah as rottenness.

28:005:013 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then
           went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet
           could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.

28:005:014 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to
           the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will
           take away, and none shall rescue him.

28:005:015 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their
           offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek
           me early.

28:006:001 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and
           he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

28:006:002 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will
           raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

28:006:003 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his
           going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto
           us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

28:006:004 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do
           unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the
           early dew it goeth away.

28:006:005 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them
           by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light
           that goeth forth.

28:006:006 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of
           God more than burnt offerings.

28:006:007 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have
           they dealt treacherously against me.

28:006:008 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted
           with blood.

28:006:009 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of
           priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit
           lewdness.

28:006:010 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is
           the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

28:006:011 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I
           returned the captivity of my people.

28:007:001 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim
           was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit
           falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers
           spoileth without.

28:007:002 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all
           their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about;
           they are before my face.

28:007:003 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes
           with their lies.

28:007:004 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who
           ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it
           be leavened.

28:007:005 In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with
           bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

28:007:006 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they
           lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the
           morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

28:007:007 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges;
           all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that
           calleth unto me.

28:007:008 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a
           cake not turned.

28:007:009 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not:
           yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth
           not.

28:007:010 And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do
           not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

28:007:011 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to
           Egypt, they go to Assyria.

28:007:012 When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will
           bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise
           them, as their congregation hath heard.

28:007:013 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto
           them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have
           redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.

28:007:014 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they
           howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and
           wine, and they rebel against me.

28:007:015 Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they
           imagine mischief against me.

28:007:016 They return, but not to the most High: they are like a
           deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the
           rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land
           of Egypt.

28:008:001 Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle
           against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed
           my covenant, and trespassed against my law.

28:008:002 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

28:008:003 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall
           pursue him.

28:008:004 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes,
           and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they
           made them idols, that they may be cut off.

28:008:005 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled
           against them: how long will it be ere they attain to
           innocency?

28:008:006 For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it
           is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

28:008:007 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the
           whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if
           so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.

28:008:008 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles
           as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.

28:008:009 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:
           Ephraim hath hired lovers.

28:008:010 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I
           gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of
           the king of princes.

28:008:011 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be
           unto him to sin.

28:008:012 I have written to him the great things of my law, but they
           were counted as a strange thing.

28:008:013 They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and
           eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember
           their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to
           Egypt.

28:008:014 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and
           Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire
           upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

28:009:001 Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast
           gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon
           every cornfloor.

28:009:002 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new
           wine shall fail in her.

28:009:003 They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall
           return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.

28:009:004 They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall
           they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them
           as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be
           polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into
           the house of the LORD.

28:009:005 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast
           of the LORD?

28:009:006 For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall
           gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places
           for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be
           in their tabernacles.

28:009:007 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are
           come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the
           spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and
           the great hatred.

28:009:008 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a
           snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of
           his God.

28:009:009 They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of
           Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will
           visit their sins.

28:009:010 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your
           fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time:
           but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that
           shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.

28:009:011 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from
           the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.

28:009:012 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,
           that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when
           I depart from them!

28:009:013 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but
           Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.

28:009:014 Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a
           miscarrying womb and dry breasts.

28:009:015 All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for
           the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine
           house, I will love them no more: all their princes are
           revolters.

28:009:016 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no
           fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the
           beloved fruit of their womb.

28:009:017 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto
           him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

28:010:001 Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:
           according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the
           altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made
           goodly images.

28:010:002 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he
           shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.

28:010:003 For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not
           the LORD; what then should a king do to us?

28:010:004 They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant:
           thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the
           field.

28:010:005 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of
           Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the
           priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof,
           because it is departed from it.

28:010:006 It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king
           Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be
           ashamed of his own counsel.

28:010:007 As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the
           water.

28:010:008 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be
           destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their
           altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to
           the hills, Fall on us.

28:010:009 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they
           stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity
           did not overtake them.

28:010:010 It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people
           shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind
           themselves in their two furrows.

28:010:011 And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to
           tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I
           will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall
           break his clods.

28:010:012 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up
           your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he
           come and rain righteousness upon you.

28:010:013 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have
           eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way,
           in the multitude of thy mighty men.

28:010:014 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy
           fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in
           the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her
           children.

28:010:015 So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness:
           in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

28:011:001 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son
           out of Egypt.

28:011:002 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed
           unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

28:011:003 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but
           they knew not that I healed them.

28:011:004 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was
           to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I
           laid meat unto them.

28:011:005 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian
           shall be his king, because they refused to return.

28:011:006 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his
           branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.

28:011:007 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they
           called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.

28:011:008 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,
           Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee
           as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are
           kindled together.

28:011:009 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not
           return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy
           One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

28:011:010 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion:
           when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the
           west.

28:011:011 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out
           of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses,
           saith the LORD.

28:011:012 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel
           with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful
           with the saints.

28:012:001 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he
           daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a
           covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.

28:012:002 The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish
           Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he
           recompense him.

28:012:003 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his
           strength he had power with God:

28:012:004 Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and
           made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there
           he spake with us;

28:012:005 Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.

28:012:006 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and
           wait on thy God continually.

28:012:007 He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he
           loveth to oppress.

28:012:008 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out
           substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in
           me that were sin.

28:012:009 And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet
           make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the
           solemn feast.

28:012:010 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied
           visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the
           prophets.

28:012:011 Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they
           sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps
           in the furrows of the fields.

28:012:012 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served
           for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.

28:012:013 And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by
           a prophet was he preserved.

28:012:014 Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall
           he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD
           return unto him.

28:013:001 When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel;
           but when he offended in Baal, he died.

28:013:002 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten
           images of their silver, and idols according to their own
           understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say
           of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.

28:013:003 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early
           dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the
           whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the
           chimney.

28:013:004 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou
           shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.

28:013:005 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great
           drought.

28:013:006 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were
           filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they
           forgotten me.

28:013:007 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the
           way will I observe them:

28:013:008 I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and
           will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour
           them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.

28:013:009 O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine
           help.

28:013:010 I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in
           all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a
           king and princes?

28:013:011 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my
           wrath.

28:013:012 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.

28:013:013 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is
           an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the
           breaking forth of children.

28:013:014 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem
           them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I
           will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine
           eyes.

28:013:015 Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall
           come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness,
           and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be
           dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

28:013:016 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against
           her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be
           dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped
           up.

28:014:001 O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen
           by thine iniquity.

28:014:002 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take
           away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we
           render the calves of our lips.

28:014:003 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses:
           neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are
           our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.

28:014:004 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for
           mine anger is turned away from him.

28:014:005 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily,
           and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.

28:014:006 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the
           olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

28:014:007 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall
           revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof
           shall be as the wine of Lebanon.

28:014:008 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I
           have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree.
           From me is thy fruit found.

28:014:009 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent,
           and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right,
           and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall
           fall therein.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
