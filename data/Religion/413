CHURCH HISTORY

At the request of Mr. John Wentworth, Editor, and Proprietor of
the "Chicago Democrat," I have written the following sketch of the
rise, progress, persecution, and faith of the Latter-Day Saints,
of which I have the honor, under God, of being the founder. Mr.
Wentworth says, that he wishes to furnish Mr. Bastow, a friend of
his, who is writing the history of New Hampshire, with this
document. As Mr. Bastow has taken the proper steps to obtain
correct information, all that I shall ask at his hands is that he
publish the account entire, ungarnished, and without
misrepresentation.

I was born in the town of Sharon, Windsor co., Vermont, on the
23d of December, A.D. 1805. When ten years old my parents removed
to Palmyra, New York, where we resided about four years, and from
thence we removed to the town of Manchester.

My father was a farmer and taught me the art of husbandry. When
about fourteen years of age I began to reflect upon the importance
of being prepared for a future state, and upon enquiring [of] the
plan of salvation I found that there was a great clash in
religious sentiment; if I went to one society they referred me to
one plan, and another to another, each one pointing to his own
particular creed as the summum bonum of perfection: considering
that all could not be right, and that God could not be the author
of so much confusion I determined to investigate the subject more
fully, believing that if God had a church it would not be split up
into factions, and that if he taught one society to worship one
way, and administer in one set of ordinances, He would not teach
another, principles which were diametrically opposed. Believing
the word of God I had confidence in the declaration of James; "If
any man lack wisdom let him ask of God who giveth to all men
liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him," I retired
to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord,
while fervently engaged in supplication my mind was taken away
from the objects with which I was surrounded, and I was enwrapped
in a heavenly vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly
resembled each other in features and likeness, surrounded with a
brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noon-day. They told me
that all religious denominations were believing in incorrect
doctrines and that none of them was acknowledged of God as His
Church and kingdom. And I was expressly commanded to "go not after
them," at the same time receiving a promise that the fullness of
the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me.

On the evening of the 21st of September, A.D. 1823, while I was
praying unto God, and endeavoring to exercise faith in the
precious promises of scripture on a sudden a light like that of
day, only of a far purer and more glorious appearance, and
brightness burst into the room, indeed the first sight was as
though the house was filled with consuming fire; the appearance
produced a shock that affected the whole body; in a moment a
personage stood before me surrounded with a glory yet greater than
that with which I was already surrounded. This messenger
proclaimed himself to be an angel of God sent to bring the joyful
tidings, that the covenant which God made with ancient Israel was
at hand to be fulfilled, that the preparatory work for the second
coming of the Messiah was speedily to commence; that the time was
at hand for the gospel, in all its fulness to be preached in power,
unto all nations that a people might be prepared for the millennial
reign.

I was informed that I was chosen to be an instrument in the
hands of God to bring about some of His purposes in this glorious
dispensation.

I was also informed concerning the aboriginal inhabitants of
this country [America], and shown who they were, and from whence
they came; a brief sketch of their origin, progress, civilization,
laws, governments, of their righteousness and iniquity, and the
blessings of God being finally withdrawn from them as a people was
made known unto me: I was also told where there was deposited some
plates on which were engraven an abridgment of the records of the
ancient prophets that had existed on this continent. The angel
appeared to me three times the same night and unfolded the same
things. After having received many visits from the angels of God
unfolding the majesty and glory of the events that should
transpire in the last days, on the morning of the 22d of September,
A.D. 1827, the angel of the Lord delivered the records into my
hands.

These records were engraven on plates which had the appearance
of gold, each plate was six inches wide and eight inches long and
not quite so thick as common tin. They were filled with engravings,
in Egyptian characters and bound together in a volume, as the leaves
of a book with three rings running through the whole. The volume was
something near six inches in thickness, a part of which was sealed.
The characters on the unsealed part were small, and beautifully
engraved. The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity in its
construction and much skill in the art of engraving. With the
records was found a curious instrument which the ancients called
"Urim and Thummim," which consisted of two transparent stones set in
the rim of a bow fastened to a breastplate.

Through the medium of the Urim and Thummim I translated the
record by the gift, and power of God.

In this important and interesting book the history of ancient
America is unfolded, from its first settlement by a colony that came
from the Tower of Babel, at the confusion of languages to the
beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era. We are informed
by these records that America in ancient times has been inhabited by
two distinct races of people. The first were called Jaredites and
came directly from the Tower of Babel. The second race came directly
from the city of Jerusalem, about six hundred years before Christ.
They were principally Israelites, of the descendants of Joseph. The
Jaredites were destroyed about the time that the Israelites came
from Jerusalem, who succeeded them in the inheritance of the
country. The principal nation of the second race fell in battle
towards the close of the fourth century. The remnant are the Indians
that now inhabit this country. This book also tells us that our
Savior made his appearance upon this continent after his
resurrection, that he planted the gospel here in all its fulness,
and richness, and power, and blessing; that they had apostles,
prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists; the same order, the
same priesthood, the same ordinances, gifts, powers, and blessings,
as was enjoyed on the eastern continent, that the people were cut
off in consequence of their transgressions, that the last of their
prophets who existed among them was commanded to write an abridgment
of their prophecies, history, &c., and to hide it up in the earth,
and that it should come forth and be united with the bible for the
accomplishment of the purposes of God in the last days. For a more
particular account I would refer to the Book of Mormon, which can be
purchased at Nauvoo, or from any of our travelling elders.

As soon as the news of this discovery was made known, false
reports, misrepresentation, and slander flew as on the wings of the
wind in every direction, the house was frequently beset by mobs, and
evil designing people, several times I was shot at, and very
narrowly escaped, and every device was made use of to get the plates
away from me, but the power and blessing of God attended me, and
several began to believe my testimony.

On the 6th of April, 1830, the "Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints," was first organized in the town of Manchester,
Ontario co., state of New York. Some few were called and ordained by
the spirit of revelation, and prophecy, and began to preach as the
spirit gave them utterance, and though weak, yet were they
strengthened by the power of God, and many were brought to
repentance, were immersed in the water, and were filled with the
Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. They saw visions and
prophesied, devils were cast out and the sick healed by the laying
on of hands. From that time the work rolled forth with astonishing
rapidity, and churches were formed in the states of New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri; in the last
named state a considerable settlement was formed in Jackson co.;
numbers joined the Church and we were increasing rapidly; we made
large purchases of land, our farms teemed with plenty, and peace
and happiness were enjoyed in our domestic circle and throughout our
neighborhood; but as we could not associate with our neighbors who
were, many of them of the basest of men, and had fled from the face
of civilized society, to the frontier country to escape the hand of
justice in their midnight revels, their Sabbath breaking, horse
racing, and gambling, they commenced at first to ridicule, then to
persecute, and finally an organized mob assembled and burned our
houses, tarred and feathered, and whipped many of our brethren and
finally drove them from their habitations; who, houseless, and
homeless,  contrary to law, justice, and humanity, had to wander on
the bleak prairies till the children left the tracks of their blood
on the prairie, this took place in the month of November, and they
had no other covering but the canopy of heaven, in this inclement
season of the year; this proceeding was winked at by the government
and although we had warrantee deeds for our land, and had violated
no law we could obtain no redress.

There were many sick, who were thus inhumanly driven from their
houses, and had to endure all this abuse and to seek homes where
they could be found. The result was, that a great many of them
being deprived of the comforts of life, and the necessary
attendances, died; many children were left orphans, wives widows,
and husbands widowers.--Our farms were taken possession of by the
mob, many thousands of cattle, sheep, horses, and hogs were taken
and our household goods, store goods, and printing press, and type
were broken, taken, or otherwise destroyed.

Many of our brethren removed to Clay where they continued until
1836, three years; there was no violence offered but there were
threatnings of violence. But in the summer of 1836, these threatnings
began to assume a more serious form; from threats, public meetings
were called, resolutions were passed, vengeance and destruction were
threatened, and affairs again assumed a fearful attitude, Jackson
county was a sufficient precedent, and as the authorities in that
county did not interfere, they boasted that they would not in this,
which on application to the authorities we found to be too true, and
after much violence, privation and loss of property we were again
driven from our homes.

We next settled in Caldwell, and Davies counties, where we made
large and extensive settlements, thinking to free ourselves from the
power of oppression, by settling in new counties with very few
inhabitants in them; but here we were not allowed to live in peace,
but in 1838 we were again attacked by mobs, an exterminating order
was issued by Gov. Boggs, and under the sanction of law an organized
banditti ranged through the country, robbed us of our cattle, sheep,
horses, hogs, &c., many of our people were murdered in cold blood,
the chastity of our women was violated, and we were forced to sign
away our property at the point of the sword, and after enduring every
indignity that could be heaped upon us by an inhuman, ungodly band of
marauders, from twelve to fifteen thousand souls men, women, and
children were driven from their own fire sides, and from lands that
they had warrantee deeds of, houseless, friendless, and homeless (in
the depth of winter,) to wander as exiles on the earth or to seek an
asylum in a more genial clime, and among a less barbarous people.

Many sickened and died, in consequence of the cold, and hardships
they had to endure; many wives were left widows, and children
orphans, and destitute. It would take more time than is allotted me
here to describe the injustice, the wrongs, the murders, the
bloodshed, the theft, misery, and woe that have been caused by the
barbarous, inhuman, and lawless, proceedings of the state of Missouri.

In the situation before alluded to we arrived in the state of
Illinois in 1839, where we found a hospitable people and a friendly
home; a people who were willing to be governed by the principles of
law and humanity. We have commenced to build a city called "Nauvoo"
in Hancock co., we number from six to eight thousand here besides
vast numbers in the county around and in almost every county of the
state. We have a city charter granted us and a charter for a legion
the troops of which now number 1500. We have also a charter for a
university, for an agricultural and manufacturing society, have our
own laws and administrators, and possess all the privileges that
other free and enlightened citizens enjoy.

Persecution has not stopped the progress of truth, but has only
added fuel to the flame, it has spread with increasing rapidity,
proud of the cause which they have espoused and conscious of our'
innocence and of the truth of their system amidst calumny and
reproach have the elders of this Church gone forth, and planted
the gospel in almost every state in the Union; it has penetrated
our cities, it has spread over our villages and has caused
thousands of our intelligent, noble, and patriotic citizens to obey
its divine mandates, and be governed by its sacred truths. It has
also spread into England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales: in the year
1839 where a few of our missionaries were sent over five thousand
joined the standard of truth, there are numbers now joining in
every land.

Our missionaries are going forth to different nations, and in
Germany, Palestine, New Holland, the East Indies, and other places,
the standard of truth has been erected: no unhallowed hand can stop
the work from progressing, persecutions may rage, mobs may combine,
armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will
go forth boldly, nobly, and independent till it has penetrated
every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and
sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be
accomplished and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.

We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in his son Jesus
Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.

We believe that men will be punished for their own sins and not
for Adam's transgression.

We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may
be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.

We believe that these ordinances are 1st, Faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ; 2d, Repentance; 3d, Baptism by immersion for the
remission of sins; 4th, Laying on of hands for the gift of the
Holy Ghost.

We believe that a man must be called of God by "prophesy, and
by laying on of hands" by those who are in authority to preach the
gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.

We believe in the same organization that existed in the
primitive church, viz, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers,
evangelists &c.

We believe in the gift of tongues, prophesy, revelation,
visions, healing, interpretation of tongues &c.

We believe the bible to be the word of God as far as it is
translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the
word of God.

We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now
reveal, and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and
important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.

We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the
restoration of the Ten Tribes. That Zion will be built upon this
[the American] continent. That Christ will reign personally upon
the earth, and that the earth will be renewed and receive its
paradisiac glory.

We claim the privilege of worshipping Almighty God according to
the dictates of our conscience, and allow all men the same
privilege let them worship how, where, or what they may.

We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and
magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.

We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous,
and in doing good to all men; indeed we may say that we follow the
admonition of Paul "we believe all things we hope all things," we
have endured many things and hope to be able to endure all things.
If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praise
worthy we seek after these things.

   Respectfully &c.,
              JOSEPH SMITH

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
