HYMNS
FOR
CHRISTIAN DEVOTION;
ESPECIALLY ADAPTED TO
THE UNIVERSALIST DENOMINATION


BY J. G. ADAMS AND E. H. CHAPIN.

TWENTY-SECOND EDITION.

BOSTON:
ABEL TOMPKINS.

PREFACE.


In presenting this work to the public, the compilers would say, that they
do not intend it as a rival of any other Hymn Book already in existence;
but, if advancement in the light of other good works be allowable, as an
improvement on them all. Although evidently designed in one sense for a
denomination, they have also intended that it shall answer in some
measure the demands of a liberal and progressive Christianity--a
Christianity, under whatever name or pretension found, that would diffuse
Christ's spirit and do his works of truth and love among men.

We have sought to give variety in these Hymns; to have the number ample
enough; and while cautious in reference to their literary character, to
select those of a devotional tendency, rather than those chiefly
commendable for their poetical excellence. We have intended also to pay
due respect to the old Hymns so justly familiar with those of every age
among our worshippers, while we have not been unmindful of the new
claimants of public favor.

It will be perceived that there is a greater variety of Hymns on several
topics than in most other Hymn Books now in use among us; especially in
reference to the philanthropic nature of our religion, and the peculiar
indications of this nature in the present age. In the department of the
book entitled "Triumph of Christianity," faithfulness in representing
this great truth is designed. In all instances where the authorship of a
hymn could be ascertained, it has been given. Of a few hymns, however,
taken from a copy of the new Cambridge Unitarian Hymn Book, kindly handed
us in sheets, it was not known whether they were original or not. They
appear in this book, therefore, in company with quite a number of
original ones, without any special mark thus to designate them.

To the friends who have so kindly aided us, by suggestions or
contributions, we return our sincere thanks; and to the Christian public
do we now humbly dedicate this work, invoking the blessing of God upon
its use, and praying that it may be welcomed by many souls seeking the
aids and blessings of Christian devotion.

                                                            J. G. Adams,

Above, below, where'er I gaze,                                       116
According to thy gracious word,                                      690
Affliction is a stormy deep,                                         609
Again our ears have heard the voice,                                  83
Again our earthly cares we leave,                                     32
Again the Lord of life and light,                                     60
A glance from heaven with sweet effect,                              526
A glory gilds the sacred page,                                       186
A holy air is breathing round,                                       917
Ah! wretched souls who strive in vain,                               443
A King shall reign in righteousness,                                 255
All from the sun's uprise,                                           166
All hail the power of Jesus' name,                                   246
All hail, ye servants of the Lord,                                   770
All nature dies and lives again,                                     550
All nature feels attractive power,                                   381
All nature's works his praise declare,                               984
All men are equal in their birth,                                    766
All powerful, self-existent God,                                     146
All ye nations, praise the Lord,                                      94
Almighty former of creation's plan,                                  121
Almighty God, in humble prayer,                                      459
Almighty God, thy wondrous works,                                    139
Almighty King, whose wondrous hand,                                  515
Almighty Maker, Lord of all,                                         489
Almighty Lord, before thy throne,                                    874
Along my earthly way,                                                521
Amazing, beauteous change,                                           312
Am I an Israelite indeed,                                            502
Am I a soldier of the cross,                                         369
Amid surrounding gloom and waste,                                    994
Amidst a world of hopes and fears,                                   487
And art thou with us, gracious Lord,                                 627
And can my heart aspire so high,                                     481
And is the gospel peace and love,                                    357
And is there, Lord, a rest,                                          563
And now, my soul, another year,                                      895
Angels! roll the rock away,                                          235
Another day is past,                                                 950
Another six days' work is done,                                       58
Approach not the altar with gloom in thy soul,                       965
Approach, thou blessed of the Lord,                                  663
Around Bethesda's healing wave,                                      221
Arrayed in clouds of golden light,                                   210
As body when the soul has fled,                                      773
As bowed by sudden storms, the rose,                                 579
As earth's pageant passes by,                                        421
Asleep in Jesus, blessed sleep,                                      549
As in solemn congregation,                                           687
As o'er the past my memory strays,                                   893
A soldier's course, from battles won,                                340
As showers on meadows newly mown,                                    292
As the evening shadows gather,                                       716
As the hart with eager looks,                                        428
As the sweet flower that scents the morn,                            582
As twilight's gradual veil is spread,                                551
As when the deluge waves were gone,                                  968
At God's command the morning ray,                                    857
At the portals of thy house,                                          72
Auspicious morning, hail,                                            846
Author of good, to thee we turn,                                     430
A voice from the desert comes awful and shrill,                      199
Awake, my soul, and with the sun,                                    936
Awake, my soul, lift up thine eyes,                                  367
Awake, my soul, stretch every nerve,                                 368
Awake our souls, away our fears,                                     370
Baptized into our Saviour's death,                                   671
Before Jehovah's awful throne,                                         4
Begin, my soul, the exalted lay,                                     161
Begin the high celestial strain,                                     169
Behold, amid his little flock,                                       683
Behold my servant, see him rise,                                     198
Behold, on Zion's heavenly shore,                                    561
Behold th' amazing sight,                                            247
Behold the grace appears,                                            206
Behold the lofty sky,                                                188
Behold the morning sun,                                              280
Behold the path which mortals tread,                                 541
Behold the Prince of Peace,                                          216
Behold the Saviour on the cross,                                     231
Behold the western evening light,                                    544
Behold, what wondrous grace,                                         442
Behold where breathing love divine,                                  225
Behold where in a mortal form,                                       239
Be it my only wisdom here,                                           457
Beneath our feet and o'er our head,                                  531
Bereft, of all, when hopeless care,                                  633
Beset with snares on every hand,                                     455
Be thou, O God, exalted high,                                        149
Be with me, Lord, where'er I go,                                     488
Beyond, beyond that boundless sea,                                   108
Blessed be thy name forever,                                         170
Blessed state and happy he,                                          964
Bless, O bless, Almighty Father,                                     997
Bless, O Lord, each opening year,                                    894
Blest are the humble souls that see,                                 344

Blest be the tie that binds,                                         659
Blest day of God, most calm, most bright,                              8
Blest hour, when mortal man retires,                                  44
Blest instructor! from thy ways,                                     334

Blest who with generous pity glows,                                  780
Blest with unearthly bliss were they,                                911
Blow ye the trumpet, blow,                                           261

Lamp of our feet, whose hallowed beam,                               194
Lay her gently in the dust,                                          587
Lead us with thy gentle sway,                                        516
Let all the earth their voices raise,                                295
Let all the heathen writers join,                                    193
Let children hear the mighty deeds,                                  839
Let deepest silence all around,                                      464
Let every mortal ear attend,                                         257
Let monumental pillars rise,                                         990
Let not the wise their wisdom boast,                                 650
Let others boast how strong they be,                                 524
Let party names no more,                                             396
Let Pharisees of high esteem,                                        776
Let plenteous grace descend on those,                                673
"Let there be light," when from on high,                             975
Let the whole race of creatures lie,                                 145
Let us join as God commands,                                         905
Let us with a gladsome mind,                                         153
Let Zion's watchmen all awake,                                       719
Life is a span, a fleeting hour,                                     584
Lift aloud the voice of praise,                                      713
Lift your glad voices in triumph on high,                            552
Light of life, seraphic fire,                                        484
Like Israel's hosts to exile driven,                                 838
Like morning, when her early breeze,                                 426
Like shadows gliding o'er the plain,                                 532
Lo, God is here, let us adore,                                        54
Long as the darkening cloud abode,                                   302
Long be our Father's temple ours,                                    970
Lord, before thy presence come,                                       28
Lord, bring me to resign,                                            462
Lord, deliver, thou canst save,                                      802
Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing,                                   98
Lord, from whom all blessings flow,                                  407
Lord, have mercy when we pray,                                       323
Lord, how delightful 'tis to see,                                     95
Lord, I believe, thy power I own,                                    468
Lord, I have made thy word my choice,                                195
Lord, in heaven thy dwelling place,                                   39
Lord, in thy garden agony,                                           480
Lord Jesus, come, for here,                                          819
Lord, lead the way the Saviour went,                                 778
Lord, must we die, O let us die,                                     539
Lord, my times are in thy hand,                                      611
Lord, now we part in thy blest name,                                  93
Lord of the worlds above,                                             21
Lord of glory, King of power,                                        953
Lord of heaven, and earth, and ocean,                                880
Lord of my life, O may thy praise,                                   940
Lord of the sea, thy potent sway,                                    828
Lord of the wide extended main,                                      825
Lord of the worlds below,                                            867
Lord, in thy Zion's wall,                                            714
Lord, send thy word and let it run,                                  808
Lord, subdue our selfish will,                                       392
Lord, teach a little child to pray,                                  762
Lord, that I may learn of thee,                                      505
Lord, thou art good, all nature shows,                               130
Lord, thou didst arise and say,                                      824
Lord, thou hast searched and seen me through,                        109
Lord, we adore thy wondrous grace,                                   661
Lord, we come before thee now,                                        22
Lord, we believe a rest remains,                                     479
Lord, we have wandered from thy way,                                 328
Lord, when thou saidst "so let it be,"                               176
Lord, when thy people seek thy face,                                  35
Lord, while for all mankind we pray,                                 837
Lord, who's the happy man that may,                                  347
Lo, the day of rest declineth,                                        91
Lo, the lilies of the field,                                         179
Lo! the prisoner is released,                                        601
Loud, raise the notes of joy,                                        847
Lo, what a glorious sight appears,                                   301
Lo, what an entertaining sight,                                      918
Love divine, all love excelling,                                      15
Mark, how the swift-winged minutes fly,                              900
Mark the soft falling snow,                                          293
Mere human power shall fast decay,                                   405
Messiah Lord! who wont to dwell,                                     222
Mid homes and shrines forsaken,                                      797
Mighty One, before whose face,                                       724
Millions of souls in glory now,                                      688
Millions within thy courts have been,                                 99
Mistaken souls that dream of heaven,                                 389
Morning breaks upon the tomb,                                        236
My country, 'tis of thee,                                            836
My dear Redeemer and my Lord,                                        238
My Father, cheering name,                                            102
My Father, grant thy presence nigh,                                  610
My Father, when around me spread,                                    529
My God, accept my early vows,                                         65
My God, how endless is thy love                                      941
My God, I now from sleep awake,                                      956
My God, I thank thee, may no thought,                                621
My God, my King, thy various praise,                                 158
My God, permit me not to be,                                         433
My God, permit my tongue,                                            492
My God, the covenant of thy love,                                    486
My God, thy service well demands,                                    932
My helper, God, I bless his name,                                    889
My Maker and my King,                                                124
My Shepherd is the Lord on high,                                     648
My soul before thee prostrate lies,                                  331
My soul, be on thy guard,                                            343
My soul, how lovely is the place,                                     31
Mysterious are the ways of God,                                      631
No change of times shall ever shock,                                 624
No loud avenging voice,                                              204
Not different food, nor different dress,                             399
Not for the pious dead we weep,                                      568
Not for the prophet tongue of fire,                                  718
Not for the summer's hour alone,                                     985
Not in the church-yard shall he sleep,                               834
Not with terror do we meet,                                          679
Not with the flashing steel,                                         807
No warlike sounds awoke the night,                                   810
No war nor battle's sound,                                           806
Now, gracious Lord, thine arm reveal,                                892
Now is the day of grace,                                             265
Now let our prayers ascend to thee,                                  870
Now, Lord, the heavenly seed is sown,                                 87
Now pray we for our country,                                         850
Now the shades of night are gone,                                    938
Now to the Lord a noble song,                                        260
O bow thine ear, Eternal One,                                        698
O cease, my wandering soul,                                          474
O come, and let th' assembly all,                                    906
O come, loud anthems let us sing,                                      5
O could we speak the matchless worth,                                240
O'er mountain tops the mount of God,                                 811
O'er the dark wave of Galilee,                                       219
O Father, draw us after thee,                                        612
O Father, though the anxious fear,                                    38
O for a closer walk with God,                                        460
O for a faith that will not shrink,                                  377
O for a heart to praise my God,                                      472
O for a prophet's fire,                                              689
O for a shout of sacred joy,                                         237
O for the death of those,                                            604
O God, by whom the seed is given,                                     86
O God, my Father, and my King,                                       384
O God, my helper, ever near,                                         891
O God, my strength, my hope,                                         425
O God of Freedom, hear us pray,                                      799
O God of love, with cheering ray,                                    535
O God, that madest earth and sky,                                    931
O God, thou art my God alone,                                        493
O God, thy grace impart,                                             335
O God, thy name they well may praise,                                827
O God unseen, but not unknown,                                       540
O God, we praise thee, and confess,                                  164
O God, whose presence glows in all,                                   34
O happy day that fixed my choice,                                    664
O happy is the man who hears,                                        404
O happy soul that lives on high,                                     406
O help us, Lord, each hour of need,                                  446
O here, if ever, God of love,                                        676
O it is joy in one to meet,                                          903
O let your mingling voices rise,                                     211
O Lord, another day is flown,                                        933
O Lord, my best desire fulfil,                                       619
O Lord, thy heavenly grace impart,                                   497
O Lord, thy perfect word,                                            191
O Lord, whose forming hand one blood,                                800
O may our sympathizing breasts,                                      382
Omniscient God, 'tis thine to know,                                  398
One prayer I have, all prayers in one,                               499
One sweet flower has drooped and faded,                              761
On eyes that never saw the day,                                      218
On light beams breaking from above,                                  620
O not alone with outward sign,                                       821
On the first Christian Sabbath eve,                                   56
On this fair spot where nature pays,                                 702
On thy church, O Power Divine,                                       308
Onward Christian, though the region,                                 720
Onward speed thy conquering flight,                                  318
On what has now been sown,                                            89
On Zion, his most holy mount,                                        290
On Zion's holy walls,                                                597
Open, Lord, my inward ear,                                           982
Oppression shall not always reign,                                   805
O praise ye the Lord, prepare a new song,                            162
O render thanks to God above,                                        154
O shut not out sweet pity's ray,                                     817
O sinner, bring not tears alone,                                     330
O speed thee, Christian, on thy way,                                 361
O spirit of the living God,                                          723
O stay thy tears, for they are blest,                                569
O sweet it is to know, to feel,                                      507
O that the Lord would guide my ways,                                 475

O Thou, to whom all creatures bow,                                   134
O Thou, to whom in ancient time,                                      16
O Thou, who art above all height,                                    707
O Thou, who didst ordain the word,                                   710
O Thou, who driest the mourner's tear,                               632

O timely happy, timely wise,                                         935
O 'tis a lovely thing to see,                                        352
O 'tis a scene the heart to move,                                    920

Ours is a lovely world, how fair,                                    173
Our times are in thy hand, and Thou,                                 520
O weep not for the joys that fade,                                   602

Remark, my soul, the narrow bounds,                                  887
Remember thy Creator,                                                740

Saviour, thy law we love,                                            672
Saviour, who thy flock art feeding,                                  668
Say, why should friendship grieve for those,                         581
Scorn not the slightest word or deed,                                822
Searcher of hearts! before thy face,                                 461

See lovely nature raise her head,                                    554
Send down thy winged angel, God,                                     930
Servant of God, well done,                                           593
Servants of Christ, arise,                                           356
See the leaves around us falling,                                    756
See what a living stone,                                             254
Shine forth, Eternal Source of light,                                494
Shine on our souls, Eternal God,                                      78
Since o'er thy footstool here below,                                 143
Sing, ye redeemed of the Lord,                                       651
Sinner, rouse thee from thy sleep,                                   268
Sister, thou wast mild and lovely,                                   590
Slavery and death the cup contains,                                  793
So fades the lovely blooming flower,                                 583
Soft are the fruitful showers that bring,                            336
Softly fades the twilight ray,                                        79
Softly now the light of day,                                         955
Soldier to the contest pressing,                                     992
So let our lips and lives express,                                   339
Sometimes a light surprises,                                         415
Soon as I heard my Father say,                                       622
Soon will our fleeting hours be past,                                 92
Sound the full chorus, let praises ascend,                           309
Sovereign of life, before thine eye,                                 530
Sovereign of worlds above,                                           715
Sow in the morn thy seed,                                            772
Spirit of grace, and help, and power,                                 77
Stand up and bless the Lord,                                           3
Still in shades of midnight darkness,                                313
Stretched on the cross the Saviour dies,                             232
Suppliant, lo! thy children bend,                                    748
Supreme and universal light,                                         429
Sweet day! so cool, so calm, so bright,                              962
Sweet is the bliss of souls serene,                                  414
Sweet is the friendly voice,                                         327
Sweet is the prayer whose holy stream,                               366
Sweet is the scene when virtue dies,                                 543
Sweet is the task, O Lord,                                            43
Sweet is the time of spring,                                         745
Sweet is the work, my God, my King,                                   61
Sweet to the soul the parting ray,                                   958
Swell the anthem, raise the song,                                    881
Talk with us, Lord, thyself reveal,                                  503
Teach me, my God and King,                                           406
Teach me, O teach me, Lord, thy way,                                 477
Teach us to feel as Jesus prayed,                                    251
The air of death breathes through our souls,                         603
The billows swell, the winds are high,                               832
The bird let loose in eastern skies,                                 451
The bird that soars on highest wing,                                 353
The Christian warrior, see him stand,                                362
The darkened sky, how thick it lowers,                               607
The day is past and gone,                                            951
The evils that beset our path,                                       527
The fountain in its source,                                          508
The glorious universe around,                                        394
The God of harvest praise,                                           876
The God of mercy will indulge,                                       595
The God who reigns alone,                                            137
The heavenly spheres to thee, O God,                                 177
The heaven of heavens cannot contain,                                118
The heavens declare his glory,                                       181
The heavens declare thy glory, Lord,                                 185
The heavens, O Lord, thy power proclaim,                             178
The hoary frost, the fleecy snow,                                    866
The hours of evening close,                                          957
The joyful morn, my God, is come,                                     62
The King of heaven his table spreads,                                277
The last full wain has come,--has come,                              879
The leaves around me falling,                                        865
The long lost son, with streaming eyes,                              324
The Lord descended from above,                                       144
The Lord is on his holy throne,                                     1005
The Lord Jehovah reigns,                                             113
The Lord my pasture shall prepare,                                   495
The Lord of glory is my light,                                       645
The Lord our God is clothed with might,                              105
The Lord will come and not be slow,                                  285
The man in life wherever placed,                                     413
The mellow eve is gliding,                                           944
The morning dawns upon the place,                                    227
The mourners came at break of day,                                   605
Theories which thousands cherish,                                   1002
The past is dark with sin and shame,                                 999
The perfect world by Adam trod,                                      697
The promises I sing,                                                 639
The radiant dawn of gospel light,                                    311
There is a God, all nature speaks,                                   101
There is a hope, a blessed hope,                                     380
There is a land mine eye hath seen,                                  564
There is a land of pure delight,                                     555
There is an hour of peaceful rest,                                   557
There is a pure and peaceful wave,                                   991
There is a time when moments flow,                                   960
There is a world we have not seen,                                   560
There's a refuge of peace from the tempests that beat,                25
There's not a star whose twinkling light,                            122
There's not a place in earth's vast round,                           147
There sprang a tree of deadly name,                                  796
There was joy in heaven,                                             333
The saints on earth and those above,                                 395
The Saviour gently calls,                                            669
The Saviour, what a noble flame,                                     223
These mortal joys, how soon they fade,                               525
The spacious firmament on high,                                      175
The spirit in our hearts,                                            275
The spirit moved upon the waves,                                     115
The spring, the joyous spring is come,                               862
The thing my God doth hate,                                          490
The triumphs of the martyred saints,                                 979
The turf shall be my fragrant shrine,                                183
The vineyard of the Lord,                                            722
The wandering star and fleeting wind,                                326
The year begins with promises,                                       858
They who seek the throne of grace,                                   365
Think gently of the erring,                                          813
This child we dedicate to thee,                                      567
This day let grateful praise ascend,                                  40
This day the Lord hath called his own,                                41
This is the fast the Lord doth choose,                               868
This is the first and great command,                                 385
This stone to thee in faith we lay,                                  696
Thou art, Almighty, Lord of all,                                     141
Thou art gone to the grave,                                          567
Thou art, O God, the life and light,                                 174
Thou art the way, and he who sighs,                                  243
Thou book of life, in thee are found,                                196
Thou fount of love and grace,                                        701
Thou gavest, and we yield to thee,                                   588
Thou faint and sick, and worn away,                                  971
Though lost to our sight, we may not deplore thee,                   758
Thou God of hope, to thee we bow,                                    782
Thou God of truth and love,                                          912
Thou, Lord, by mortal eyes unseen,                                   253
Thou, Lord, by strictest search hast known,                          140
Thou must go forth alone, my soul,                                   537
Thou power supreme, whose mighty scheme,                             635
Thou whose wide extended sway,                                       307
Thrice happy soul, who, born from heaven,                            342
Through all the changing scenes of life,                             617
Through endless years thou art the same,                             127
Through every age, Eternal God,                                      898
Through sorrow's night and danger's way,                             360
Through the day thy love has spared us,                              952
Through thee we now together come,                                   922
Thus far the Lord has led me on,                                     945
Thus saith the first, the great command,                             355
Thus saith the high and lofty One,                                   364
Thus saith the Lord who built the heavens,                           252
Thus shall thou love th' Almighty Lord,                              341
Th' uplifted eye and bended knee,                                    390
Thy kingdom, Lord, forever stands,                                   132
Thy life I read, my dearest Lord,                                    666
Thy name be hallowed, evermore,                                      100
Thy presence everlasting God,                                        923
Thy presence, gracious God, afford,                                   23
Thy ways, O Lord, with wise design,                                  148
Times without number have I prayed,                                  332
Time by moments steals away,                                         896
Time! what an empty vapor 'tis,                                      897
'Tis a point I long to know,                                         454
'Tis by the faith of joys to come,                                   374
'Tis done, the great transaction's done,                             674
'Tis finished, so the Saviour cried,                                 233
'Tis God the spirit leads,                                           510
'Tis good to weep and mourn for those,                               804
'Tis gone, that bright and orbed blaze,                              948
'Tis midnight, and on Olive's brow,                                  228
'Tis my happiness below,                                             614
To Christ, the Son, the Father spake,                                322
To keep the lamp alive,                                              427
To Thee, great source of light,                                      156
To Thee, my God and Saviour,                                         646
To Thee, my God, my days are known,                                  616
To Thee, my God! to thee I bring,                                    963
'Twas God who fixed the rolling spheres,                             104
'Twas on that dark and doleful night,                                677
Unveil thy bosom, faithful tomb,                                     546
Upon the gospel's sacred page,                                       296
Vital spark of heavenly flame,                                       542
Wait, O my soul, thy Maker's will,                                   628
Walk in the light, so shalt thou know,                               998
Watchman, tell us of the night,                                      200
We bid thee welcome in the name,                                     711
We bless thee for this sacred day,                                    55
We come, O Lord, before thy throne,                                  835
We come our Sabbath hymn to raise,                                   759
We come to thee, O God,                                              818
We come with joy and gladness,                                       755
We gather in the name of God,                                        729
We have met in peace together,                                       749
Welcome, delightful morn,                                             12
Welcome, sweet day of rest,                                           46
We long to see that happy time,                                      310
We mourn for those who toil,                                         570
We praise thee if one rescued soul,                                  789
Were not the sinful Mary's tears,                                    273

INTRODUCTION AND CLOSE OF WORSHIP.




1.               7s. M.                   Bowring.

Humble Worship


1   When before thy throne we kneel,
      Filled with awe and holy fear,
    Teach us, O our God! to feel
      All thy sacred presence near.

2   Check each proud and wandering thought
      When on thy great name we call;
    Man is nought--is less than nought:
      Thou, our God, art all in all.

3   Weak, imperfect creatures, we
      In this vale of darkness dwell;
    Yet presume to look to thee,
      'Midst thy light ineffable.

4   O, receive the praise that dares
      Seek thy heaven-exalted throne;
    Bless our offerings, hear our pray'rs,
      Infinite and Holy One!




2.                P. M.                 Anonymous.

Solemn Invocation.


1   Come, thou Almighty King!
    Help us thy name to sing;
      Help us to praise!
    Father all glorious,
    O'er all victorious,
    Come and reign over us,
      Ancient of days!

2   Come, thou all gracious Lord!
    By heaven and earth adored,
      Our prayer attend!
    Come, and thy children bless;
    Give thy good word success;
    Make thine own holiness
      On us descend!

3   Never from us depart;
    Rule thou in every heart,
      Hence, evermore!
    Thy sovereign majesty
    May we in glory see,
    And to eternity
      Love and adore.




3.                S. M.                Montgomery.

Exhortation to Praise.


1     Stand up and bless the Lord,
      Ye people of his choice;
    Stand up, and bless the Lord your God,
      With heart, and soul and voice.

2     Though high above all praise,
      Above all blessing high,
    Who would not fear his holy name,
      And laud and magnify?

3     O for the living flame
      From his own altar brought,
    To touch our lips, our minds inspire,
      And wing to heaven our thought!

4     There, with benign regard,
      Our hymns he deigns to hear;
    Though unrevealed to mortal sense,
      The spirit feels him near.

5     Stand up and bless the Lord,
      The Lord your God adore;
    Stand up and bless his glorious name,
      Henceforth for evermore.




4.                L. M.                     Watts.

Public Worship.


1   Before Jehovah's awful throne,
      Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;
    Know that the Lord is God alone;
      He can create, and he destroy.

2   His sovereign power, without our aid,
      Made us of clay, and formed us men;
    And when, like wandering sheep we strayed,
      He brought us to his fold again.

3   We are his people; we his care;
      Our souls, and all our mortal frame:
    What lasting honors shall we rear,
      Almighty Maker, to thy name?

4   We'll crowd thy gates, with thankful songs
      High as the heaven our voices raise;
    And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
      Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.

5   Wide as the world is thy command;
      Vast as eternity thy love;
    Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,
      When rolling years shall cease to move.




5.                L. M.              Tate & Brady.

The Same.


1   O, Come, loud anthems let us sing,
    Loud thanks to our Almighty King;
    For we our voices high should raise,
    When our salvation's Rock we praise.

2   Into his presence let us haste,
    To thank him, for his favors past;
    To him address, in joyful songs,
    The praise that to his name belongs.

3   O, let us to his courts repair,
    And bow with adoration there;
    With joy and fear devoutly all
    Before the Lord, our Maker, fall!




6.                L. M.                     Watts.

"How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts."


1   Great God! attend, while Zion sings
    The joy that from thy presence springs;
    To spend one day with thee, on earth,
    Exceeds a thousand days of mirth.

2   Might I enjoy the meanest place
    Within thy house, O God of grace,
    Not tents of ease, nor thrones of power,
    Should tempt my feet to leave thy door.

3   God is our Sun--he makes our day;
    God is our shield--he guards our way;
    All needful grace he will bestow,
    And crown that grace with glory too.

4   O God! our king, whose sovereign sway
    The glorious hosts of heaven obey,
    Thy willing servants may we be,
    For blest are they who trust in thee.




7.                C. M.                  Edmeston.

The Lord's Day.


1   When the worn spirit wants repose,
      And sighs her God to seek,
    How sweet to hail the evening's close
      That ends the weary week!

2   How sweet to hail the early dawn
      That opens on the sight,
    When first that soul-reviving morn
      Beams its new rays of light!

3   Blest day! thine hours too soon will cease
      Yet, while they gently roll,
    Breathe, Heavenly Spirit, source of peace,
      A sabbath o'er my soul!




8.                C. M.             Codman's Coll.

The Blessing of the Sabbath.


1   Blest day of God! most calm, most bright,
      The first and best of days;
    The laborer's rest, the saint's delight,
      The day of prayer and praise.

2   My Saviour's face made thee to shine;
      His rising thee did raise;
    And made thee heavenly and divine
      Beyond all other days.

3   The first fruits oft a blessing prove
      To all the sheaves behind;
    And they who do the Sabbath love,
      A happy week will find.

4   This day I must to God appear;
      For, Lord, the day is thine;
    Help me to spend it in thy fear,
      And thus to make it mine.




9.                C. M.               Mrs. Follen.

Love of Sabbath Service.


1   How sweet, upon this sacred day,
      The best of all the seven,
    To cast our earthly thoughts away,
      And think of God and heaven!

2   How sweet to be allowed to pray
      Our sins may be forgiven!
    With filial confidence to say,
      "Father, who art in heaven!"

3   How sweet the words of peace to hear
      From him to whom 'tis given
    To wake the penitential tear,
      And lead the way to heaven!

4   And if, to make our sins depart,
      In vain the will has striven,
    He who regards the inmost heart
      Will send his grace from heaven.




10.             L. M. 6l.             Mrs. Steele.

A Prayer for Lord's Day.


1   Great God, this sacred day of thine
    Demands our souls' collected powers.
    May we employ in work divine
    These solemn, these devoted hours;
    O may our souls adoring own
    The grace which calls us to thy throne.

2   Hence, ye vain cares and trifles, fly;
    Where God resides appear no more;
    Omniscient God, thy piercing eye
    Can every secret thought explore:
    O may thy grace our hearts refine,
    And fix our thoughts on things divine.

3   The word of life dispensed to-day
    Invites us to a heavenly feast.
    May every ear the call obey;
    Be every heart a humble guest;
    O bid the wretched sons of need
    On soul-reviving dainties feed.

4   Thy spirit's powerful aid impart;
    O may thy word, with life divine,
    Engage the ear, and warm the heart;
    Then shall the day indeed be thine;
    Then shall our souls adoring own
    The grace which calls us to thy throne.




11.               C. M.               H. Ware, Jr.

Invoking God's Aid.


1   Father in heaven, to thee my heart
      Would lift itself in prayer;
    Drive from my soul each earthly thought
      And show thy presence there.

2   Each moment of my life renews
      The mercies of my Lord,
    Each moment is itself a gift
      To bear me on to God.

3   O, help me break the galling chains,
      This world has round me thrown,
    Each passion of my heart subdue,
      Each darling sin disown.

4   O Father, kindle in my breast
      A never dying flame
    Of holy love, of grateful trust
      In thine almighty name.




12.               H. M.                   Hayward.

Invocation for Lord's Day Morning.


1     Welcome, delightful morn,
        Thou day of sacred rest!
      We hail thy glad return:
        Lord, make these moments blest.
    From low delights and mortal toys
    We soar to reach immortal joys.

2     Now may the King descend,
        And fill his throne of grace;
      Thy sceptre, Lord, extend,
        While we address thy face.
    O let us feel thy quickening word,
    And learn to know and fear the Lord.

3     Descend, celestial Dove,
        With all thy quickening powers;
      Disclose a Saviour's love,
        And bless these sacred hours:
    Then shall our souls new life obtain,
    Nor sabbaths be enjoyed in vain.




13.             C. P. M.                      Day.

Attendance on Worship.


1   I'll bless Jehovah's glorious name,
    Whose goodness heaven and earth proclaim,
        With every morning light;
    And at the close of every day,
    To him my cheerful homage pay,
        Who guards me through the night.

2   Then in his churches to appear,
    And pay my humble worship there,
        Shall be my sweet employ:
    The day that saw my Saviour rise
    Shall dawn on my delighted eyes
        With pure and holy joy.

3   With grateful sorrow in my breast,
    I'll celebrate the dying feast
        Of my exalted Lord;
    And, while his perfect love I view,
    His bright example I'll pursue,
        And meditate his word.




14.             S. P. M.                    Watts.

Delight in the House of God.


1     How pleased and blest was I
      To hear the people cry,
    "Come, let us seek our God to-day!"
      Yes, with a cheerful zeal,
      We haste to Zion's hill,
    And there our vows and honors pay.

2     Zion, thrice happy place,
      Adorned with wondrous grace,
    And walls of strength embrace thee round;
      In thee our tribes appear,
      To pray, and praise, and hear
    The sacred gospel's joyful sound.

3     May peace attend thy gate,
      And joy within thee wait,
    To bless the soul of every guest;
      The man who seeks thy peace,
      And wishes thine increase,
    A thousand blessings on him rest.




15.            8 & 7s. M.           Wesley's Coll.

Divine Love.


1   Love divine, all love excelling,
      Joy of heaven, to earth come down!
    Fix in us thy humble dwelling,
      All thy faithful mercies crown.
    Father! thou art all compassion,
      Pure, unbounded love thou art;
    Visit us with thy salvation,
      Enter every longing heart.

2   Breathe, O breathe thy loving spirit
      Into every troubled breast;
    Let us all in thee inherit,
      Let us find thy promised rest.
    Come, almighty to deliver,
      Let us all thy life receive,
    Graciously come down, and never,
      Never more thy temples leave.




16.               L. M.                  Pierpont.

Universal Worship.


1   O Thou, to whom, in ancient time,
      The lyre of Hebrew bards was strung,
    Whom kings adored in song sublime,
      And prophets praised with glowing tongue!

2   Not now on Zion's height alone
      Thy favored worshipper may dwell;
    Nor where, at sultry noon, thy Son,
      Sat weary, by the Patriarch's well.

3   From every place below the skies,
      The grateful song, the fervent prayer--
    The incense of the heart--may rise
      To Heaven, and find acceptance there.

4   To thee shall age, with snowy hair,
      And strength and beauty bend the knee,
    And childhood lisp, with reverent air,
      Its praises and its prayers to thee.

5   O Thou, to whom, in ancient time,
      The lyre of prophet-bards was strung,
    To thee, at last, in every clime
      Shall temples rise, and praise be sung.




17.               C. M.         Presbyterian Coll.

Prayer for special Favor.


1   Within thy house, O Lord, our God,
      In glory now appear;
    Make this a place of thine abode,
      And shed thy blessings here.

2   When we thy mercy-seat surround,
      Thy Spirit, Lord, impart;
    And let thy gospel's joyful sound
      With power reach every heart.

3   Here let the blind their sight obtain;
      Here give the mourners rest;
    Let Jesus here triumphant reign,
      Enthroned in every breast.

4   Here let the voice of sacred joy
      And humble prayer arise,
    Till higher strains our tongues employ
      In realms beyond the skies.




18.               C. M.                     Watts.

Daily and nightly Devotion.


1   Ye that obey the immortal King,
      Attend his holy place;
    Bow to the glories of his name,
      And sing his wondrous grace.

2   Lift up your hands by morning light,
      And raise your thanks on high;
    Send your admiring thoughts, by night,
      Above the starry sky.

3   The God of Zion cheer your hearts
      With rays of quickening grace:
    'Tis he that spreads the heavens abroad,
      Whose presence fills the place.




19.               S. M.                Montgomery.

The Delight of Worship.


1     Glad was my heart to hear
      My old companions say
    Come, in the house of God appear,
      For 'tis a holy day.

2     Our willing feet shall stand
      Within thy temple-door;
    While young and old in many a band
      Shall throng the sacred floor.

3     Within these walls be peace
      And harmony be found:
    Zion, in all thy palaces,
      Prosperity abound!

4     For friends and brethren dear,
      Our prayer shall never cease
    Oft as they meet for worship here,
      God send his people peace!




20.               S. M.                 E. Taylor.

Call to the House of Prayer.


1     Come to the house of prayer,
      O ye afflicted, come:
    The God of peace shall meet you there--
      He makes that house his home.

2     Come to the house of praise,
      Ye who are happy now;
    In sweet accord your voices raise,
      In kindred homage bow.

3     Ye aged, hither come,
      For ye have felt his love:
    Soon shall your trembling tongues be dumb,
      Your lips forget to move.

4     Ye young, before his throne,
      Come, bow; your voices raise;
    Let not your hearts his praise disown
      Who gives the power to praise.

5     Thou, whose benignant eye
      In mercy looks on all--
    Who see'st the tear of misery,
      And hear'st the mourner's call--

6     Up to thy dwelling-place
      Bear our frail spirits on,
    Till they outstrip time's tardy pace,
      And heaven on earth be won.

Delight in Public Worship.


1     Lord of the worlds above,
        How pleasant and how fair
      The dwellings of thy love,
        Thine earthly temples, are!
    To thine abode my heart aspires,
    With warm desires to see my God.

2     O happy souls that pray
        Where God appoints to hear!
      O happy men that pay
        Their constant service there!
    They praise thee still; and happy they
    Who love the way to Zion's hill.

3     They go from strength to strength,
        Throughout these mortal years,
      Till each arrives at length,
        Till each in heaven appears:
    O glorious seat, when God, our King,
    Shall thither bring our willing feet!

A Blessing humbly requested.


1   Lord, we come before thee now;
    At thy feet we humbly bow;
    O, do not our suit disdain;
    Shall we seek thee, Lord, in vain?

2   In thine own appointed way,
    Now we seek thee; here we stay;
    Lord, from hence we would not go,
    Till a blessing thou bestow.

3   Comfort those who weep and mourn;
    Let the time of joy return;
    Those that are cast down, lift up;
    Make them strong in faith and hope.

4   Grant that all may seek and find
    Thee a God supremely kind;
    Heal the sick; the captive free;
    Let us all rejoice in thee.

For Opening or Close of Service.


1   Thy presence, gracious God, afford;
    Prepare us to receive thy word;
    Now let thy voice engage our ear,
    And faith be mixed with what we hear.

2   Distracting thoughts and cares remove,
    And fix our hearts and hopes above;
    With food divine may we be fed,
    And satisfied with living bread.

3   To us the sacred word apply
    With sovereign power and energy;
    And may we, in thy faith and fear,
    Reduce to practice what we hear.

4   Father, in us thy Son reveal;
    Teach us to know and do thy will;
    Thy saving power and love display,
    And guide us to the realms of day.

Seeking Refuge.


1   Forth from the dark and stormy sky,
    Lord, to thine altar's shade we fly;
    Forth from the world, its hope and fear,
    Father, we seek thy shelter here:
    Weary and weak, thy grace we pray;
    Turn not, O Lord, thy guests away.

2   Long have we roamed in want and pain;
    Long have we sought thy rest in vain;
    Wildered in doubt, in darkness lost,
    Long have our souls been tempest-tost:
    Low at thy feet our sins we lay;
    Turn not, O Lord, thy guests away.

The House of God.


1   There's a refuge of peace from the tempests that beat,
      From the dark clouds that threaten, the wild wind that blows;
    A holy, a sweet and a lovely retreat,
      A spring of refreshment, a place of repose.

2   'Tis the house of my God, 'tis the dwelling of prayer,
      The temple all hallowed by blessing and praise;
    If sorrow and faithlessness conquer me, there
      My heart to the throne of his grace I can raise.

3   For a refuge like this, ah, what praises are due!
      For a rest so serene, for a covert so fair:
    Ah, why are the seasons of worship so few?
      And why are so seldom the meetings of prayer?

The Fount of Blessing.


1   Far from mortal cares retreating,
      Sordid hopes, and vain desires,
    Here our willing footsteps meeting,
      Every heart to heaven aspires.

2   From the fount of glory beaming,
      Light celestial cheers our eyes,
    Mercy from above proclaiming
      Peace and pardon from the skies.

3   Who may share this great salvation?
      Every pure and humble mind,
    Every kindred, tongue, and nation,
      From the stains of guilt refined.

4   Blessings all around bestowing,
      God withholds his care from none,
    Grace and mercy ever flowing
      From the fountain of his throne.

1   Great Shepherd of thy people, hear;
      Thy presence now display;
    We kneel within thy house of prayer;
      O, give us hearts to pray.

2   The clouds which veil thee from our sight,
      In pity, Lord, remove;
    Dispose our minds to hear aright
      The message of thy love.

3   Help us, with holy fear and joy,
      To kneel before thy face;
    O, make us, creatures of thy power,
      The children of thy grace.

Preparation for Worship.


1   Lord, before thy presence come,
      Bow we down with holy fear;
    Call our erring footsteps home,
      Let us feel that thou art near.

2   Wandering thoughts and languid powers
      Come not where devotion kneels;
    Let the soul expand her stores,
      Glowing with the joy she feels.

3   At the portals of thine house,
      We resign our earth-born cares;
    Nobler thoughts our souls engross,
      Songs of praise and fervent prayers.

"Hallowed be Thy name."


1   Holy and reverend is the name
      Of our eternal King;
    Thrice holy Lord, the angels cry;
      Thrice holy, let us sing.

2   The deepest reverence of the mind
      Pay, O my soul, to God;
    Lift with thy hands a holy heart
      To his sublime abode.

3   With sacred awe pronounce his name,
      Whom words nor thoughts can reach;
    A broken heart shall please him more
      Than the best forms of speech.

4   Thou holy God! preserve my soul
      From all pollution free;
    The pure in heart are thy delight,
      And they thy face shall see.

Pleasures of Spiritual Worship.


1     How sweet to bless the Lord,
      And in his praises join,
    With saints his goodness to record,
      And sing his power divine!

2     These seasons of delight
      The dawn of glory seem,
    Like rays of pure, celestial light,
      Which on our spirits beam.

3     O, blest assurance this;
      Bright morn of heavenly day;
    Sweet foretaste of eternal bliss,
      That cheers the pilgrim's way.

4     Thus may our joys increase,
      Our love more ardent grow,
    While rich supplies of Jesus' grace
      Refresh our souls below.

God present in the Sanctuary.


1   My Soul, how lovely is the place
      To which thy God resorts!
    'Tis heaven to see his smiling face,
      Though in his earthly courts.

2   There the great Monarch of the skies
      His saving power displays;
    And light breaks in upon our eyes
      With kind and quickening rays.

3   With his rich gifts the heavenly Dove
      Descends and fills the place,
    While Christ reveals his wondrous love,
      And sheds abroad his grace.

4   There, mighty God, thy words declare
      The secrets of thy will;
    And still we seek thy mercy there,
      And sing thy praises still.

      And to thy courts repair;
    Again, with joyful feet we come
      To meet our Saviour here.

2   The feeling heart, the melting eye,
      The humble mind, bestow;
    And shine upon us from on high,
      To make our graces grow.

3   May we in faith receive thy word,
      In faith present our prayers,
    And in the presence of our Lord
      Unbosom all our cares.

4   Show us some token of thy love,
      Our fainting hope to raise,
    And pour thy blessing from above,
      That we may render praise.

1   For thee, O God, our constant praise
      In Zion waits, thy chosen seat;
    Our promised altars there we'll raise,
      And all our zealous vows complete.

2   O thou, who to my humble prayer
      Didst always bend thy listening ear,
    To thee shall all mankind repair,
      And at thy gracious throne appear.

3   Our sins, though numberless, in vain
      To stop thy flowing mercy try;
    For thou wilt cleanse the guilty stain,
      And wash away the crimson dye.

4   Blest is the man, who, near thee placed,
      Within thy sacred dwelling lives;
    Whilst we at humbler distance taste
      The vast delight thy worship gives.

Truth and Love.


1   O God, whose presence glows in all,
      Within, around us, and above!
    Thy word we bless, thy name we call,
      Whose word is Truth, whose name is Love.

2   That truth be with the heart believed
      Of all who seek this sacred place;
    With power proclaimed, in peace received--
      Our spirits' light, thy Spirit's grace.

3   That love its holy influence pour,
      To keep us meek, and make us free,
    And throw its binding blessing more
      Round each with all, and all with thee.

4   Send down its angel to our side--
      Send in its calm upon the breast;
    For we would know no other guide,
      And we can need no other rest.

Invoking a Blessing.


1   Lord! when thy people seek thy face,
      And dying sinners pray to live,
    Hear thou in heaven, thy dwelling-place,
      And, when thou hearest, O forgive!

2   Here, when thy messengers proclaim
      The blessed Gospel of thy Son,
    Still, by the power of his great name,
      Be mighty signs and wonders done.

3   But will indeed Jehovah deign
      Here to abide, no transient guest?
    Here will the world's Redeemer reign,
      And here the Holy Spirit rest?

4   That glory never hence depart!
      Yet choose not, Lord, this house alone;
    Thy kingdom come to every heart,
      In every bosom fix thy throne.

A Prayer for Lord's Day.


1   Safely through another week
      Thou hast brought us on our way;
    Let us now thy blessing seek,
      Waiting in thy courts to-day:
    Day, of all the week the best--
    Emblem of eternal rest.

2   Mercies multiplied each hour
      Through the week our praise demand:
    Guarded by almighty power,
      Fed and guided by thy hand,
    May we not forgetful be,
    Nor ungrateful, Lord, to thee.

3   While we seek supplies of grace
      Through the dear Redeemer's name,
    Show thy reconciling face,
      Take away our sin and shame.
    From our worldly cares set free,
    May we rest this day in thee.

4   May the gospel's joyful sound
      Conquer sinners, comfort saints;
    Make the fruits of grace abound;
      Bring relief from all complaints.
    Thus let all our sabbaths prove,
    Till we join the church above.

Evening Worship.


1   How shall we praise thee, Lord of light!
      How shall we all thy love declare!
    The earth is veiled in shades of night,
      But heaven is open to our prayer,--
    That heaven so bright with stars and suns--
      That glorious heaven which has no bound,
    Where the full tide of being runs,
      And life and beauty glow around.

2   We would adore thee, God sublime!
      Whose power and wisdom, love and grace,
    Are greater than the round of time,
      And wider than the bounds of space,
    O how shall thought expression find,
      All lost in thine immensity!
    How shall we seek thee, glorious Mind,
      Amid thy dread infinity!

3   But thou art present with us here,
      As in thy glittering, high domain;
    And grateful hearts and humble fear
      Can never seek thy face in vain.
    Help us to praise thee, Lord of light!
      Help us thy boundless love declare;
    And, here within thy courts to-night,
      Aid us, and hearken to our prayer.

The Sabbath of the Soul.


1   O Father! though the anxious fear
      May cloud to-morrow's way,
    No fear nor doubt shall enter here,--
      All shall be thine to-day.

2   We will not bring divided hearts
      To worship at thy shrine;
    But each unworthy thought departs,
      And leaves this temple thine.

3   Then sleep to-day, tormenting cares,
      Of earth and folly born;
    Ye shall not dim the light that streams
      From this celestial morn.

4   To-morrow will be time enough
      To feel your harsh control;
    Ye shall not violate this day,
      The Sabbath of the soul.

Lowly Praise.


1   Lord, in heaven, thy dwelling-place,
    Hear the praises of our race,
    And, while hearing, let thy grace
      Dews of sweet forgiveness pour;
    While we know, benignant King,
    That the praises which we bring
    Are a worthless offering
      Till thy blessing makes it more.

2   More of truth, and more of might,
    More of love, and more of light,
    More of reason, and of right,
      From thy pardoning grace be given!
    It can make the humblest song
    Sweet, acceptable, and strong,
    As the strains the angels' throng
      Pour around the throne of heaven.

1   This day let grateful praise ascend
    To thee, our Father, and our Friend,
    Thee, Author of this holy light,
    Thee, throned in boundless power and might.

2   O, let the sacred hours be given
    To truth, to duty, and to heaven;
    While trusting faith and holy love
    Rise fervent to thy throne above.

3   Grant that our earthly Sabbaths be
    But dawnings of eternity,
    To shadow forth the glorious rest,
    The heavenly quiet of the blest.

Improvement of the Sabbath.


1   This day the Lord hath called his own;
      O, let us, then, his praise declare,
    Fix our desires on him alone,
      And seek his face with fervent prayer.

2   Lord, in thy love we would rejoice,
      Which bids the burdened soul be free,
    And, with united heart and voice,
      Devote these sacred hours to thee.

3   Now let the world's delusive things
      No more our grovelling thoughts employ
    But Faith be taught to stretch her wings,
      In search of heaven's unfailing joy.

4   O, let these earthly Sabbaths, Lord,
      Be to our lasting welfare blest;
    The purest comfort here afford,
      And fit us for eternal rest.

1     Hail to the Sabbath day!
      The day divinely given,
    When men to God their homage pay,
      And earth draws near to heaven.

2     Lord, in this sacred hour,
      Within thy courts we bend,
    And bless thy love, and own thy power,
      Our Father and our Friend.

3     But thou art not alone
      In courts by mortals trod;
    Nor only is the day thine own
      When man draws near to God.

4     Thy temple is the arch
      Of yon unmeasured sky;
    Thy Sabbath, the stupendous march
      Of grand eternity.

5     Lord, may that holier day
      Dawn on thy servants' sight;
    And purer worship may we pay
      In heaven's unclouded light.

    To praise thy name, and hear thy word,
      And grateful offerings bring.

2     Sweet, at the dawning hour,
      Thy boundless love to tell;
    And when the night-wind shuts the flower,
      Still on the theme to dwell.

3     Sweet, on this day of rest,
      To join in heart and voice,
    With those who love and serve thee best,
      And in thy name rejoice.

4     To songs of praise and joy,
      Be every Sabbath given,
    That such may be our blest employ
      Eternally in heaven.

The Hour of Prayer.


1   Blest hour, when mortal man retires
      To hold communion with his God,
    To send to heaven his warm desires,
      And listen to the sacred word.

2   Blest hour, when earthly cares resign
      Their empire o'er his anxious breast,
    While, all around, the calm divine
      Proclaims the holy day of rest.

3   Blest hour, when God himself draws nigh,
      Well pleased his people's voice to hear,
    To hush the penitential sigh,
      And wipe away the mourner's tear.

4   Blest hour! for, where the Lord resorts,
      Foretastes of future bliss are given,
    And mortals find his earthly courts
      The house of God, the gate of heaven.

Devout Worship of God.


1   Praise waits in Zion, Lord, for thee;
      Thy saints adore thy holy name;
    Thy creatures bend th' obedient knee,
      And, humbly, thy protection claim.

2   Thy hand has raised us from the dust;
      The breath of life thy Spirit gave;
    Where, but in thee, can mortals trust?
      Who, but our God, has power to save?

3   Still may thy children in thy word
      Their common trust and refuge see;
    O bind us to each other, Lord,
      By one great tie,--the love of thee.

4   So shall our sun of hope arise,
      With brighter still and brighter ray,
    Till thou shalt bless our longing eyes
      With beams of everlasting day.

      That saw the Lord arise;
    Welcome to this reviving breast
      And these rejoicing eyes.

2     The King himself comes near,
      And feasts his saints to-day;
    Here we may sit, and see him here,
      And love, and praise, and pray.

3     One day, amid the place
      Where my dear Lord hath been,
    Is sweeter than ten thousand days
      Of folly and of sin.

4     My willing soul would stay
      In such a frame as this,
    Till called to rise and soar away
      To everlasting bliss.

      And hymns of glory sing:
    Jehovah is the sovereign God,

2     He formed the deeps unknown;
      He gave the seas their bound;
    The watery worlds are all his own,
      And all the solid ground.

3     Come, worship at his throne;
      Come, bow before the Lord;
    We are his works, and not our own:
      He formed us by his word.

4     To-day attend his voice,
      Nor dare provoke his rod;
    Come, like the people of his choice,
      And own your gracious God.

2   Thee we adore, and, Lord, to thee
      Our filial duty pay;
    Thy service, unconstrained and free,
      Conducts to endless day.

3   While in thy house of prayer we kneel
      With trust and holy fear,
    Thy mercy and thy truth reveal,
      And lend a gracious ear.

4   With fervor teach our hearts to pray,
      And tune our lips to sing;
    Nor from thy presence cast away
      The sacrifice we bring.

The Lord's Day.


1   How welcome to the soul, when pressed
      With six days' noise, and care, and toil,
    Is the returning day of rest,
      Which hides us from the world awhile!

2   How happy they, whose lot is cast
      Where Christ invites the "weary" yet;
    They find their sorrows quickly past,
      And all their burdens soon forget.

3   Though pinched with poverty at home,
      With sharp afflictions daily fed,
    It makes amends, if they can come
      To God's own house for heavenly bread.

4   We thank thee for thy day, O Lord!
      And here thy promised presence seek;
    Open thy hand with blessings stored,
      And give us manna for the week.

Christian Worship.


1   Father of all! where shall we find
      A temple suited to thy praise?
    To thee, the uncreated Mind,
      What earthly altar shall we raise?

2   We'll call a multitude around,
      And gladly seek the house of prayer;
    There thy salvation we have found,
      And still, O God, we'll seek it there.

3   From breast to breast the holy flame
      Shall kindle round the sacred place:
    At once we'll hymn our Father's name,
      At once we'll seek our Father's face.

4   There, heavenly Father, condescend
      To meet us with peculiar love;
    And when the hymns of earth shall end,
      We'll give thee nobler hymns above.

1   Father! adored in worlds above,
      Thy glorious name be hallowed still;
    Thy kingdom come with power and love,
      And earth, like heaven, obey thy will.

2   Lord! make our daily wants thy care;
      Forgive the sins which we forsake:
    And, as we in thy kindness share,
      Let fellow-men of ours partake.

3   Evils beset us every hour;
      Thy kind protection we implore:
    Thine is the kingdom, thine the power;
      Be thine the glory evermore!

Mutual Invitation.


1   Come, let us join our souls to God
      In everlasting bands,
    And seize the blessings he bestows
      With eager hearts and hands.

2   Come, let us to his temple haste,
      And seek his favor there,
    Before his footstool humbly bow,
      And offer fervent prayer.

3   Come, let us share, without delay,
      The blessings of his grace;
    Nor shall the years of distant life
      Their mem'ry e'er efface.

4   O, may our children ever haste
      To seek their fathers' God,
    Nor e'er forsake the happy path
      Their fathers' feet have trod.

"The Lord God is a Sun and Shield."  Ps. 84.


1   How lovely are thy dwellings fair,
      O Lord of hosts, how dear
    The pleasant tabernacles are
      Where thou dost dwell so near!

2   Happy, who in thy house reside,
      Where thee they ever praise,
    Happy, whose strength in thee doth bide,
      And in their hearts thy ways.

3   They pass through sorrow's thirsty vale,
      That dry and barren ground,
    As through a fruitful, wat'ry dale,
      Where springs and showers abound.

4   They journey on from strength to strength,
      With joy and gladsome cheer,
    Till all before our God at length
      In Zion do appear.

5   For God the Lord, both sun and shield,
      Gives grace and glory bright;
    No good from them shall be withheld
      Whose ways are just and right.

1   Lo, God is here! Let us adore,
      And humbly bow before his face;
    Let all within us feel his power;
      Let all within us seek his grace.

2   Lo, God is here! Him, day and night
      United choirs of angels sing:
    To him, enthroned above all height,
      Heaven's host their noblest homage bring.

3   Being of beings! may thy praise
      Thy courts with grateful fragrance fill:
    Still may we stand before thy face--
      Still hear and do thy sovereign will.

Sabbath Day.


1   We bless thee for this sacred day,
      Thou who hast every blessing given,
    Which sends the dreams of earth away,
      And yields a glimpse of opening heaven.

2   Lord, in this day of holy rest,
      We would improve the calm repose;
    And, in thy service truly blest,
      Forget the world, its joys and woes.

3   Lord! may thy truth, upon the heart,
      Now fall and dwell as heavenly dew,
    And flowers of grace in freshness start
      Where once the weeds of error grew.

4   May prayer now lift her sacred wings,
      Contented with that aim alone
    Which bears her to the King of kings,
      And rests her at his sheltering throne.

Introduction to Evening Worship.


1   On the first Christian Sabbath eve,
      When his disciples met
    O'er his lost fellowship to grieve,
      Nor knew the Scripture yet,--

2   Lo! in their midst his form was seen,--
      The form in which he died;
    Their Master's marred and wounded mien,--
      His hands, his feet, his side.

3   Then were they glad their Lord to know,
      And hailed him, yet with fear;--
    Jesus, again thy presence show;
      Meet thy disciples here.

4   Be in our midst; let faith rejoice
      Our risen Lord to view,
    And make our spirits hear thy voice
      Say, "Peace be unto you!"




57.               C. M.                     Watts.

Going to Church.  Ps. 122.


1   How did my heart rejoice to hear
      My friends devoutly say,
    "In Zion let us all appear,
      And keep the solemn day!"

2   Up to her courts, with joys unknown,
      The holy tribes repair:
    The Son of David holds his throne,
      And sits in judgment there.

3   Peace be within this sacred place,
      And joy a constant guest;
    With holy gifts and heavenly grace
      Be her attendants blest.

4   My soul shall pray for Zion still
      While life or breath remains;
    There my best friends, my kindred, dwell;
      There God, my Saviour, reigns.

Sabbath Morning.


1   Another six days' work is done,
    Another Sabbath is begun:
    Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest,
    Improve the day which God hath blest.

2   O that our thoughts and thanks may rise,
    As grateful incense, to the skies,
    And draw from heaven that sweet repose,
    Which none but he that feels it knows!

3   This heavenly calm within the breast
    Is the dear pledge of glorious rest,
    Which for the church of God remains,
    The end of cares, the end of pains.

4   In holy duties let the day--
    In holy pleasures--pass away:
    How sweet, a Sabbath thus to spend,
    In hope of one that ne'er shall end!




59.              7s. M.          Miss H. F. Gould.

The Sabbath.


1   Choice of God, thou blessed day,
    At thy dawn the grave gave way
    To the power of him within,
    Who had, sinless, bled for sin.

2   Thine the radiance to illume
    First, for man, the dismal tomb,
    When its bars their weakness owned,
    There revealing death dethroned.

3   Then the Sun of righteousness
    Rose, a darkened world to bless,
    Bringing up from mortal night
    Immortality and light.

4   Day of glory, day of power,
    Sacred be thine every hour,
    Emblem, earnest of the rest
    That remaineth for the blest!




60.               C. M.             Mrs. Bareauld.

The Lord's Day Morning.


1   Again the Lord of life and light
      Awakes the kindling ray,
    Unseals the eyelids of the morn,
      And pours increasing day.

2   O what a night was that which wrapped
      The heathen world in gloom!
    O what a sun which broke, this day,
      Triumphant from the tomb!

3   This day be grateful homage paid,
      And loud hosannas sung;
    Let gladness dwell in every heart,
      And praise on every tongue.

4   Ten thousand differing lips shall join
      To hail this welcome morn,
    Which scatters blessings from its wings
      To nations yet unborn.




61.               L. M.                     Watts.

Sabbath on Earth and in Heaven.  Ps. 92.


1   Sweet is the work, my God, my King,
    To praise thy name, give thanks, and sing;
    To show thy love by morning light,
    And talk of all thy truth at night.

2   Sweet is the day of sacred rest!
    No mortal cares shall seize my breast;
    O may my heart in tune be found,
    Like David's harp of solemn sound.

3   My heart shall triumph in the Lord,
    And bless his works, and bless his word:
    Thy works of grace, how bright they shine,
    How deep thy counsels, how divine!

4   But I shall share a glorious part
    When grace hath well refined my heart,
    And, raised to holier courts above,
    I praise thee with a purer love.

5   Then shall I see, and hear, and know,
    All I desired or wished below;
    And every power find sweet employ
    In that eternal world of joy.

The Sabbath and the Earthly Temple.


1   The joyful morn, my God, is come,
    That calls me to thy sacred dome,
      Thy presence to adore:
    My feet the summons shall attend,
    With willing steps thy courts ascend
      And tread the hallowed floor.

2   With holy joy I hail the day,
    That warns my thirsting soul away;
      What transports fill my breast!
    For, lo! my great Redeemer's power
    Unfolds the everlasting door,
      And leads me to his rest!

3   Hither, from earth's remotest end,
    Lo! the redeemed of God ascend,
      Their tribute hither bring;
    Here, crowned with everlasting joy,
    In hymns of praise their tongues employ,
      And hail the immortal King.

Longing for the House of God.


1   Early, my God, without delay,
      I haste to seek thy face;
    My thirsty spirit faints away
      Without thy cheering grace.

2   So pilgrims on the scorching sand,
      Beneath a burning sky,
    Long for a cooling stream at hand;
      And they must drink, or die.

3   Not life itself, with all its joys,
      Can my best passions move,
    Or raise so high my cheerful voice,
      As thy forgiving love.

4   Thus, till my last expiring day,
      I'll bless my God and King;
    Thus will I lift my hands to pray,
      And tune my lips to sing.

The Worship of Earth and Heaven.


1   Hosanna! Lord, thine angels cry:
    Hosanna! Lord, we hear reply:
    Above, beneath us, and around,
    The dead and living swell the sound.

2   O Father! with protecting care
    Meet us in this, thy house of prayer;
    Assembled in Messiah's name,
    Thy promised blessing here we claim.

3   But, chiefest, in our cleansed breast,
    Eternal! let thy Spirit rest;
    And make our secret soul to be
    A temple pure, and worthy thee.

Watchfulness and Brotherly Reproof.  Ps. 141.


1   My God, accept my early vows,
    Like morning incense, in thy house;
    And let my nightly worship rise
    Sweet as the evening sacrifice.

2   Watch o'er my lips, and guard them, Lord,
    From every rash and heedless word;
    Nor let my feet incline to tread
    The guilty path where sinners lead.

3   O may the righteous, when I stray,
    Smite and reprove my wandering way;
    Their gentle words, like ointment shed,
    Shall never bruise, but cheer, my head.

4   When I behold them prest with grief
    I'll cry to heaven for their relief;
    And by my warm petitions prove
    How much I prize their faithful love.

The Pleasure of Public Worship.  Ps. 84.


1   How pleasant, how divinely fair,
    O Lord of Hosts, thy dwellings are!
    With long desire my spirit faints
    To meet the assemblies of thy saints.

2   Blest are the souls who find a place
    Within the temple of thy grace;
    There they behold thy gentler rays,
    And seek thy face and learn thy praise.

3   Blest are the men whose hearts are set
    To find the way to Zion's gate;
    God is their Strength; and through the road
    They lean upon their Helper, God.

4   Cheerful they walk with growing strength,
    Till all shall meet in heaven at length;
    Till all before thy face appear,
    And join the nobler worship there.




67.               L. M.                C. Robbins.

"Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth."


1   While thus thy throne of grace we seek,
    O God, within our spirits speak!
    For we will hear thy voice to-day,
    Nor turn our hardened hearts away.

2   Speak in thy gentlest tones of love,
    Till all our best affections move;
    We long to hear no meaner call,
    But feel that Thou art all in all.

3   To conscience speak thy quickening word,
    Till all its sense of sin is stirred:
    For we would leave no stain of guile,
    To cloud the radiance of thy smile.

4   Speak, Father, to the anxious heart,
    Till every fear and doubt depart:
    For we can find no home or rest,
    Till with thy Spirit's whispers blest.

For a Blessing on Worship.


1     Here, gracious God! do thou
        For evermore draw nigh;
      Accept each faithful prayer,
        And mark each suppliant sigh:
    In copious shower, on all who pray,
    This holy day, thy blessings pour.

2     Here may we find from heaven
        The grace which we implore;
      And may that grace once given,
        Be with us evermore:
    Until that day, when all the blest
    To endless rest are called away.

Sabbath Hymn.


1   Called by the Sabbath bells away,
      Unto thy holy temple, Lord,
    I'll go, with willing mind to pray,
      To praise thy name and hear thy word.

2   O sacred day of peace and joy,
      Thy hours are ever dear to me;
    Ne'er may a sinful thought destroy
      The holy calm I find in thee.

3   Dear are thy peaceful hours to me,
      For God has given them in his love,
    To tell how calm, how blest shall be
      The endless day of heaven above.

The Worship of the Heart.


1   When, as returns this solemn day,
      Man comes to meet his Maker, God,
    What rites, what honors shall he pay?
      How spread his Sovereign's praise abroad?

2   From marble domes and gilded spires,
      Shall curling clouds of incense rise?
    And gems, and gold, and garlands deck
      The costly pomp of sacrifice?

3   Vain, sinful man! creation's Lord
      Thy golden offerings well may spare:
    But give thy heart, and thou shalt find
      Here dwells a God who heareth prayer.

1   Sacred day, forever blest!
    Day of all our days the best!
    Welcome hours of praise and prayer,
    Free from toil, fatigue, and care!

2   Happy, truly happy, Lord,
    Those who hear and read thy word!
    Happy those who dwell with thee!
    Who thy grace and glory see.

3   We once more have heard thy voice,
    Lord, in thee our souls rejoice;
    Borne by faith to worlds on high,
    Called to reign above the sky.

4   Though this day of rest we close,
    Still in thee our hearts repose;
    Guide and guard us all our days:
    O may all our lives be praise!

Invitation to pure Worship.


1   At the portals of thy house,
    Lord, we leave our mortal cares:
    Nobler thoughts our souls engage,
    Songs of praise, and fervent prayers.
    Pure and contrite hearts alone
    Find acceptance at thy throne.

2   Hapless men, whose footsteps stray
    From the temple of the Lord!
    Teach them Zion's heavenly way;
    To their feet thy light afford.
    Let the world unite to raise
    Solemn harmonies of praise.

Worship in spirit and in truth.


1   Father of omnipresent grace!
    We seem agreed to seek thy face:
    But every soul assembled here
    Doth naked in thy sight appear;
    Thou know'st who only bows the knee,
    And who in heart approaches thee.

2   To-day, while it is called to-day,
    Awake and stir us up to pray;
    The spirit of thy word impart,
    And breathe the life into our heart;
    Our weakness help, our darkness chase,
    And guide us by the light of grace.

Subjection to the Father of Spirits.


1   Eternal Source of light and thought!
    Be all beneath thyself forgot,
    Whilst thee, great parent-mind, we own,
    In prostrate homage round thy throne.

2   Whilst in themselves our souls survey
    Of thee some faint reflected ray,
    They wondering to their Father rise:
    His power how vast! his thoughts how wise!

3   O may we live before thy face,
    The willing subjects of thy grace;
    And through each path of duty move,
    With filial awe, and filial love.

1   God in his temple let us meet,
      In spirit, low before him bend:
    Here he hath fixed his mercy-seat,
      Here on his Sabbath we attend.

2   Arise into thy resting-place,
      Thou, and thine ark of strength, O Lord!
    Shine through the veil, we seek thy face:
      Speak, for we hearken to thy word.

3   With righteousness thy priests array:
      Joyful thy favored people be:
    Let those who teach, and those who pray,
      Let all--be holiness to thee!

1   Creator Spirit, by whose light
    The sleeping worlds were called from night!
    Come, visit every pious mind,
    Come, pour thy joys on human kind;
    From sin and sorrow set us free,
    And make us temples worthy thee.

2   Plenteous in grace descend from high,
    Rich in thy sevenfold energy;
    Our frailty help, our vice control,
    Thou ruler of our secret soul!
    And, lest our feet should haply stray
    Protect and guide us in the way.

1   Spirit of grace, and health, and power!
      Fountain of light and love below!
    Abroad thy healing influence shower;
      On all thy servants let it flow.

2   Inflame our hearts with perfect love;
      In us the work of faith fulfil:
    So not heaven's host shall swifter move,
      Than we on earth to do thy will.

3   Father! 'tis thine each day to yield
      Thy children's wants a fresh supply;
    Thou cloth'st the lilies of the field,
      And hearest the young ravens cry.

4   On thee we cast our care; we live
      Through thee, who know'st our every need:
    O feed us with thy grace, and give
      Our souls this day the living bread!

Life dedicated to God.


1   Shine on our souls, eternal God!
      With rays of beauty shine;
    O let thy favor crown our days,
      And all their round be thine.

2   Did we not raise our hands to thee,
      Our hands might toil in vain;
    Small joy success itself could give,
      If thou thy love restrain.

3   With thee let every week begin;
      With thee each day be spent;
    For thee each fleeting hour improved,
      Since each by thee is lent.

4   Thus cheer us through the checkered road,
      Till all our labors cease,
    And heaven refresh our weary souls
      With everlasting peace.

Sabbath Evening.


1   Softly fades the twilight ray
    Of the holy Sabbath day;
    Gently as life's setting sun;
    When the Christian's course is run.

2   Night her solemn mantle spreads
    O'er the earth, as daylight fades;
    All things tell of calm repose
    At the holy Sabbath's close.

3   Peace is on the world abroad;
    'Tis the holy peace of God,--
    Symbol of the peace within,
    When the spirit rests from sin.

4   Still the Spirit lingers near,
    Where the evening worshipper
    Seeks communion with the skies,
    Pressing onward to the prize.

    From folly and from sin to save.

2   May the great truths we here have heard--
    The lessons of thy holy word--
    Dwell in our inmost bosoms deep,
    And all our souls from error keep.

3   Oh! may the influence of this day,
    Long as our memory with us stay,
    And as an angel guardian prove,
    To guide us to our home above.

      Now supply thy people's need.

2   O, may all enjoy the blessing
      Which thy word's designed to give,
    Let us all, thy love possessing,
      Joyfully the truth receive,
          And forever
      To thy praise and glory live.

      At which the dead shall live;
    O, may the sound our hearts rejoice,
      And strength immortal give!

      Through my pilgrimage below,
    And beside the waters lead me,
      Where thy flock rejoicing go.

    I have found thee, and would never,
      Never wander from thee more.

1   Father! bless thy word to all;

    O, may sinners hear thy call,
      May thy people grow in love.

      Send thy heavenly truth abroad;
    May the nations hear thy voice,
      Hear it, and return to God.

"The Seed is the Word of God."


1   O God, by whom the seed is given,
      By whom the harvest blest;
    Whose word, like manna showered from heaven
      Is planted in our breast.

2   Preserve it from the passing feet,
      And plunderers of the air;
    The sultry sun's intenser heat,
      And weeds of worldly care!

3   Though buried deep, or thinly strewn,
      Do thou thy grace supply:
    The hope in earthly furrows sown
      Shall ripen in the sky.

"God giveth the Increase."


1   Now, Lord, the heavenly seed is sown,
      Be it thy servants' care
    Thy heavenly blessing to bring down
      By humble, fervent prayer.

2   In vain we plant without thine aid,
      And water, too, in vain:
    Lord of the harvest, God of grace,
      Send down thy heavenly rain.

3   Then shall our cheerful hearts and tongues
      Begin this song divine--
    "Thou, Lord, hast given the rich increase,
      And be the glory thine."

1   From worship, now, thy church dismiss--
      But not without thy blessing, Lord;
    O grant a taste of heavenly bliss,
      And seal instruction from thy word.

2   Oft may these pleasant scenes return
      When we shall meet to worship thee;
    Oft may our hearts within us burn
      To hear thy word, thy goodness see.

3   And when these pleasant scenes are past,
      To thee, our God, O may we come,
    And meet th' assembled world at last,
      In Zion, our eternal home.

    And thou alone shalt have the praise.

    Our tongues would all thy love proclaim,
    And chant the honors of thy name.

2     Here, in thine earthly house,
        Our joyful souls have met;
      Here paid our solemn vows,
        And felt our union sweet.
    For this our tongues thy love proclaim,
    And chant the honors of thy name.

3     Now may we dwell in peace
        Till here again we come;
      And may our love increase
        Till thou shalt bring us home.
    Then shall our tongues thy love proclaim,
    And chant the honors of thy name.

      Peace o'er all the scene is spread;--
    On his children meekly calling,
      Purer influence God will shed.

Sunday Evening.


1   Millions within thy courts have been;
      Millions this day have bent the knee;
    But thou, soul-searching God! hast seen
      The hearts of all that worshipped thee.

2   From east to west the sun surveyed,
      From north to south, adoring throngs;
    And still, where evening stretched her shade,
      The stars came forth to hear their songs.

3   And not a prayer, a tear, a sigh,
      Hath failed this day some suit to gain;
    To those in trouble thou wert nigh;
      Not one hath sought thy face in vain.

4   Yet one prayer more;--and be it one,
      In which both heaven and earth accord:
    Fulfil thy promise to thy Son;
      Let all that breathe call Jesus Lord!

    The living bread that came from heaven:
    Water of life on us bestow,
    Thou art the Source, the Fountain thou.

Being of God.


1   There is a God--all nature speaks,
      Through earth, and air, and sea, and skies:
    See, from the clouds his glory breaks,
      When first the beams of morning rise.

2   The rising sun, serenely bright,
      O'er the wide world's extended frame
    Inscribes, in characters of light,
      His mighty Maker's glorious name.

3   The flowery tribes, all blooming, rise
      Above the weak attempts of art;
    Their bright, inimitable dyes
    Speak sweet conviction to the heart.

4   Ye curious minds, who roam abroad,
      And trace creation's wonders o'er,
    Confess the footsteps of a God;
      Come, bow before him, and adore.

God our Father.


1     My Father! cheering name!
      O, may I call thee mine?
    Give me the humble hope to claim
      A portion so divine.

2     Whate'er thy will denies,
      I calmly would resign;
    For thou art just, and good, and wise:
      O, bend my will to thine!

3     Whate'er thy will ordains,
      O give me strength to bear
    Still let me know a father reigns,
      And trust a father's care.

4     Thy ways are little known
      To my weak, erring sight;
    Yet shall my soul, believing, own
      That all thy ways are right.

5     My Father!--blissful name!
      Above expression dear!
    If thou accept my humble claim,
      I bid adieu to fear.

1   Father! to thy kind love we owe
    All that is fair and good below;
    Bestower of the health that lies
    On tearless cheeks and cheerful eyes!

2   Giver of sunshine and of rain!
    Ripener of fruits on hill and plain!
    Fountain of light, that, rayed afar,
    Fills the vast urns of sun and star!

3   Yet deem we not that thus alone,
    Thy mercy and thy love are shown;
    For we have learned, with higher praise,
    And holier names, to speak thy ways.

4   In woe's dark hour, our kindest stay!
    Sole trust when life shall pass away!
    Teacher of hopes that light the gloom
    Of death, and consecrate the tomb!




104.              C. M.          Martineau's Coll.

Omnipotence of God.


1   'Twas God who fixed the rolling spheres,
      And stretched the boundless skies,
    Who formed the plan of endless years,
      And bade the ages rise.

2   From everlasting is his might,
      Immense and unconfined;
    He pierces through the realms of light,
      And rides upon the wind.

3   He darts along the burning sky;
      Loud thunders round him roar;
    Through worlds above his terrors fly,
      While worlds below adore.

4   He speaks,--great nature's wheels stand still
      And leave their wonted round;
    The mountains melt; each trembling hill
      Forsakes its ancient bound.

5   Ye worlds, and every living thing,
      Fulfil his high command;
    Pay grateful homage to your King,
      And own his ruling hand.

Almighty Power and Majesty of God.


1   The Lord our God is clothed with might;
      The winds obey his will;
    He speaks, and in the heavenly height
      The rolling sun stands still.

2   Rebel, ye waves, and o'er the land
      With threatening aspect roar;
    The Lord uplifts his awful hand,
      And chains you to the shore.

3   Ye winds of night, your force combine
      Without his high behest,
    Ye shall not, in the mountain pine,
      Disturb the sparrow's nest.

4   His voice sublime is heard afar;
      In distant peals it dies;
    He binds the whirlwinds to his car,
      And sweeps the howling skies.

5   Ye nations, bend; in reverence bend;
      Ye monarchs, wait his nod,
    And bid the choral song ascend
      To celebrate our God.




106.              C. M.                     Watts.

God is Everywhere.


1   In all my vast concerns with thee,
      In vain my soul would try
    To shun thy presence, Lord, or flee
      The notice of thine eye.

2   Thine all-surrounding sight surveys
      My rising and my rest;
    My public walks, my private ways,
      And secrets of my breast.

3   My thoughts lie open to the Lord,
      Before they're formed within;
    And ere my lips pronounce the word,
      He knows the sense I mean.

4   O, wondrous knowledge, deep and high;
      Where can a creature hide?
    Within thy circling arms I lie,
      Beset on every side.

5   So let thy grace surround me still,
      And like a bulwark prove,
    To guard my soul from every ill,
      Secured by sovereign love.

Eternity of God.


1   Ere mountains reared their forms sublime,
      Or heaven and earth in order stood,
    Before the birth of ancient time,
      From everlasting thou art God.

2   A thousand ages, in their flight,
      With thee are as a fleeting day;
    Past, present, future, to thy sight
      At once their various scenes display.

3   But our brief life's a shadowy dream,
      A passing thought, that soon is o'er,
    That fades with morning's earliest beam,
      And fills the musing mind no more.

4   To us, O Lord, the wisdom give,
      Each passing moment so to spend,
    That we at length with thee may live
      Where life and bliss shall never end.




108.            C. M. 6l.                  Conder.

Where is God?


1   Beyond, beyond that boundless sea,
      Above that dome of sky,
    Farther than thought itself can flee,
      Thy dwelling is on high;
    Yet dear the awful thought to me,
      That thou, my God, art nigh.

2   We hear thy voice when thunders roll
      Through the wide fields of air;
    The waves obey thy dread control:
      Yet still thou art not there.
    Where shall I find Him, O my soul,
      Who yet is everywhere?

3   O, not in circling depth, or height,
      But in the conscious breast,
    Present to faith, though veiled from sight,
      There does his spirit rest.
    O come, thou Presence Infinite,
      And make thy creatures blest.




109.              L. M.                     Watts.

The all-seeing God.


1   Lord, thou hast searched and seen me through;
    Thine eye commands, with piercing view,
    My rising and my resting hours,
    My heart and flesh, with all their powers.

2   Within thy circling power I stand;
    On every side I find thy hand:
    Awake, asleep, at home, abroad,
    I am surrounded still with God.

3   Amazing knowledge, vast and great!
    What large extent! what lofty height!
    My soul, with all the powers I boast,
    Is in the boundless prospect lost.

4   O may these thoughts possess my breast
    Where'er I rove, where'er I rest!
    Nor let my weaker passions dare
    Consent to sin; for God is there.

God Good and Omniscient.


1   How precious are thy thoughts of peace,
      O God! to me,--how great the sum!
    New every morn, they never cease;
      They were, they are, and yet shall come,
    In number and in compass more
    Than ocean's sand, or ocean's shore.

2   Search me, O God! and know my heart,
      Try me, my secret soul survey;
    And warn thy servant to depart
      From every false and evil way:
    So shall thy truth my guidance be,
    In life and immortality.

Omniscience and Omnipresence.


1   Father of all, omniscient Mind,
      Thy wisdom who can comprehend?
    Its highest point what eye can find,
      Or to its lowest depths descend?

2   If up to heaven's ethereal height,
      Thy prospect to elude, I rise,
    In splendor there supremely bright,
      Thy presence shall my sight surprise.

3   Thee, mighty God, my wondering soul,
      Thee, all her conscious powers adore,
    Whose being circumscribes the whole,
      Whose eyes the universe explore.

4   Thine essence fills this breathing frame;
      It glows in every vital part,
    Lights up our souls with livelier flame,
      And feeds with life each beating heart.

5   To thee, from whom our being came,
      Whose smile is all the heaven we know,
    Inspired with this exalted theme,
      To thee our grateful strains shall flow.




112.              C. M.                     Watts.

Infinity of God.


1   Great God, how infinite art thou!
      How weak and frail are we!
    Let the whole race of creatures bow,
      And homage pay to thee.

2   Thy throne eternal ages stood,
      Ere earth or heaven was made;
    Thou art the ever-living God,
      Were all the nations dead.

3   Eternity, with all its years,
      Stands present in thy view;
    To thee there's nothing old appears,
      Great God, there's nothing new.

4   Our lives through varying scenes are drawn,
      And vexed with trifling cares,
    While thine eternal thought moves on
      Thine undisturbed affairs.

The Majesty of God.


1     The Lord Jehovah reigns,
      And royal state maintains,
    His head with awful glories crowned,
      Arrayed in robes of light,
      Begirt with sovereign might,
    And rays of majesty around.

2     Upheld by thy commands,
      The world securely stands,
    And skies and stars obey thy word;
      Thy throne was fixed on high
      Ere stars adorned the sky;
    Eternal is thy kingdom, Lord.

3     Thy promises are true;
      Thy grace is ever new;
    There fixed, thy church shall ne'er remove;
      Thy saints, with holy fear,
      Shall in thy courts appear,
    And sing thine everlasting love.

God is Love.


1   God is love; his mercy brightens
      All the path in which we rove;
    Bliss he wakes, and woe he lightens;
      God is wisdom, God is love.

2   Chance and change are busy ever;
      Man decays, and ages move;
    But his mercy waneth never;
      God is wisdom, God is love.

3   E'en the hour that darkest seemeth
      Will his changeless goodness prove;
    From the gloom his brightness streameth,
      God is wisdom, God is love.

4   He with earthly cares entwineth
      Hope and comfort from above:
    Everywhere his glory shineth;
      God is wisdom, God is love.

God the Creator.


1   The Spirit moved upon the waves
      That darkly rolled, a shoreless sea;
    He spake the word, and light burst forth,
      A glorious, bright immensity.

2   At his command, the mountains heaved
      Their rocky pinnacles on high,
    Island and continent displayed
      Their desert grandeur to the sky.

3   The voice of God was heard again,
      And lovely flowers and graceful trees
    Appeared on every vale and plain,
      And perfumes floated on the breeze.

4   The word went forth, and vast and high
      The heavenly orbs gave out their light,
    O'er all the earth and sea and sky;
      The rulers of the day and night.




116.            L. M. 6l.       Montgomery's Coll.

Omnipresence of God.


1   Above, below, where'er I gaze,
      Thy guiding finger, Lord, I view,
    Traced in the midnight planets' blaze,
      Or glist'ning in the morning dew:
    Whate'er is beautiful or fair,
    Is but thine own reflection there.

2   And when the radiant orb of light
      Hath tipped the mountain tops with gold
    Smote with the blaze, my weary sight
      Shrinks from the wonders I behold;
    That ray of glory, bright and fair,
    Is but thy living shadow there.

3   Thine is the silent noon of night,
      The twilight eve, the dewy morn;
    Whate'er is beautiful and bright,
      Thy hands have fashioned to adorn.
    Thy glory walks in every sphere,
    And all things whisper, "God is here."

The Perfections of God.


1   How shall I praise th' eternal God,
      That infinite Unknown?
    Who can ascend his high abode,
      Or venture near his throne?

2   Those watchful eyes that never sleep,
      Survey the world around:
    His wisdom is a boundless deep,
      Where all our thoughts are drowned.

3   Speak we of strength, his arm is strong,
      To save or to destroy:
    To him eternal years belong,
      And never-ending joy.

4   He knows no shadow of a change,
      Nor alters his decrees;
    Firm as a rock his truth remains,
      To guard his promises.

"God is a Spirit."


1   The heaven of heavens cannot contain
      The universal Lord;
    Yet he in humble hearts will deign
      To dwell and be adored.

2   Where'er ascends the sacrifice
      Of fervent praise and prayer,
    Or on the earth, or in the skies,
      The God of heaven is there.

3   His presence is diffused abroad
      Through realms, through worlds unknown;
    Who seek the mercies of our God
      Are ever near his throne.




119.              C. M.                     Watts.

Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God.


1   I sing the mighty power of God,
      That made the mountains rise,
    That spread the flowing seas abroad,
      And built the lofty skies.

2   I sing the wisdom that ordained
      The sun to rule the day;
    The moon shines full at his command,
      And all the stars obey.

3   I sing the goodness of the Lord,
      That filled the earth with food;
    He formed the creatures with his word,
      And then pronounced them good.

4   There's not a plant or flower below,
      But makes thy glories known;
    And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
      By order from thy throne.

God our Father.


1   Is there a lone and dreary hour,
    When worldly pleasures lose their power?
    My Father! let me turn to thee,
    And set each thought of darkness free.

2   Is there a time of rushing grief,
    Which scorns the prospect of relief?
    My Father! break the cheerless gloom,
    And bid my heart its calm resume.

3   Is there an hour of peace and joy,
    When hope is all my soul's employ?
    My Father! still my hopes will roam,
    Until they rest with thee, their home.

4   The noontide blaze, the midnight scene,
    The dawn, or twilight's sweet serene,
    The glow of life, the dying hour,
    Shall own my Father's grace and power.

1   Almighty Former of creation's plan,
    Faintly reflected in thine image, man;
    Holy and just,--the greatness of whose name
    Rules and supports this universal frame:--

2   Whose spirit fills the infinitude of space,--
    Who art thyself thine own vast dwelling place;--
    Soul of our soul, whom yet no sense of ours
    Discerns, eluding our most active powers:--

3   Encircling shades attend thine awful throne,
    That veil thy face, and keep thee still unknown;
    Unknown, though dwelling in our inmost part,
    Lord of the thoughts, and Sovereign of the heart!

God seen in his Works.


1   There's not a star whose twinkling light
      Illumes the distant earth,
    And cheers the solemn gloom of night,
      But goodness gave it birth.

2   There's not a cloud whose dews distil
      Upon the parching clod,
    And clothe with verdure vale and hill,
      That is not sent by God.

3   There's not a place in earth's vast round,
      In ocean deep, or air,
    Where skill and wisdom are not found;
      For God is everywhere.

4   Around, within, below, above,
      Wherever space extends,
    There Heaven displays its boundless love,
      And power with goodness blends.

2   Thy hand, how wide it spread the sky!
      How glorious to behold!
    Tinged with a blue of heavenly dye,
      And decked with sparkling gold.

3   Thy glories blaze all nature round,
      And strike the gazing sight,
    Through skies, and seas, and solid ground,
      With terror and delight.

4   Almighty power, and equal skill,
      Shine through the worlds abroad,
    Our souls with vast amazement fill,
      And speak the builder, God.

2     Thou ever good and kind!
      A thousand reasons move,
    A thousand obligations bind
      My heart to grateful love.

3     The creature of thy hand,
      On thee alone I live:
    My God! thy benefits demand
      More praise than tongue can give.

4     O let thy grace inspire
      My soul with strength divine;
    Let all my powers to thee aspire,
      And all my days be thine.

      Thy goodness in full glory shines;
    Thy truth shall break through every cloud
      That veils and darkens thy designs.

2   Forever firm thy justice stands,
      As mountains their foundations keep;
    Wise are the wonders of thy hands;
      Thy judgments are a mighty deep.

3   Thy providence is kind and large;
      Both man and beast thy bounty share;
    The whole creation is thy charge,
      But saints are thy peculiar care.

4   Life, like a fountain, rich and free,
      Springs from the presence of my Lord;
    And in thy light our souls shall see
      The glories promised in thy word.

1   Great God! in vain man's narrow view
    Attempts to look thy nature through;
    Our laboring powers with reverence own
    Thy glories never can be known.

2   Not the high seraph's mighty thought,
    Who countless years his God has sought,
    Such wondrous height or depth can find,
    Or fully trace thy boundless mind.

3   And yet thy kindness deigns to show
    Enough for mortal minds to know;
    While wisdom, goodness, power divine,
    Through all thy works and conduct shine.

4   O, may our souls with rapture trace
    Thy works of nature and of grace:
    Explore thy sacred truth, and still
    Press on to know and do thy will.

    Each future age shall know thy name,

2   The strong foundations of the earth
      Of old by thee were laid;
    By thee the beauteous arch of heaven
      With matchless skill was made.

3   Soon may this goodly frame of things
      Created by thy hand,
    Be, like a vesture, laid aside,
      And changed at thy command.

4   But thy perfections, all divine,
      Eternal as thy days,
    Through everlasting ages shine,
      With undiminished rays.

Purposes of God developed by his Providence.


1   God moves in a mysterious way,
      His wonders to perform;
    He plants his footsteps in the sea,
      And rides upon the storm.

2   Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
      The clouds ye so much dread
    Are big with mercy, and shall break
      In blessings on your head.

3   Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
      But trust him for his grace;
    Behind a frowning providence
      He hides a smiling face.

4   His purposes will ripen fast
      Unfolding every hour;
    The bud may have a bitter taste,
      But sweet will be the flower.

5   Blind unbelief is sure to err,
      And scan his work in vain;
    God is his own interpreter,
      And he will make it plain.

1     In darkness as in light,

      Who looks existence through.

2   From the dim hour of birth,
      Through every changing state
    Of mortal pilgrimage on earth,
      Till its appointed date;

3     All that I am,--have been,--
      All that I yet may be,
    He sees at once, as he hath seen,
      And shall forever see.

      Its mighty Author kind:
    Thy bounty through creation flows,
      Full, free, and unconfined.

2   The whole, and every part, proclaims
      Thine infinite good-will;
    It shines in stars, and flows in streams,
      And blooms on every hill.

3   We view it o'er the spreading main,
      And heavens which spread more wide;
    It drops in gentle showers of rain,
        And rolls in every tide.

4   Through the vast whole it pours supplies,
      Spreads joy through every part:
    O, may such love attract my eyes,
        And captivate my heart!

5   My highest admiration raise,
      My best affections move!
    Employ my tongue in songs of praise,
      And fill my heart with love!

    Near whom no grief can long abide;--
    My Lord, how full of sweet content
    My years of pilgrimage are spent!

2   All scenes alike engaging prove,
    To souls impressed with sacred love;
    Where'er they dwell, they dwell in thee,
    In heaven, in earth, or on the sea.

3   To them remains nor place nor time;
    Their country is in every clime;
    They can be calm and free from care
    On any shore, since God is there.

4   While place we seek, or place we shun,
    The soul finds happiness in none;
    But with a God to guide our way,
    'Tis equal joy to go or stay.

      Its unexhausted store;
    And universal nature lives
      On thy sustaining power.

3   Holy and just in all its ways
      Is Providence divine;
    In all its works, immortal rays
      Of power and mercy shine.

4   The praise of God--delightful theme!--
      Shall fill my heart and tongue;
    Let all creation bless his name,
      In one eternal song.

A Holy God.  Ps. 99.


1     Exalt the Lord our God,
      And worship at his feet;
    His nature is all holiness,
      And mercy is his seat.

2     When Israel was his church,
      When Aaron was his priest,
    When Moses cried, when Samuel prayed,
      He gave his people rest.

3     Oft he forgave their sins,
      Nor would destroy their race;
    And oft he made his vengeance known,
      When they abused his grace.

4     Exalt the Lord our God,
      Whose grace is still the same;
    Still he's a God of holiness,
      And jealous for his name.

    The moon, that nightly rules the sky,
      With stars of feebler light,--

3   Lord, what is man, that he is blessed
      With thy peculiar care!
    Why on his offspring is conferred
      Of love so large a share?

4   O Thou, to whom all creatures bow
      Within this earthly frame,
    Through all the world how great art thou!

      Existence, form, and order gives!
    Pleased the wide cup with joy to fill,

      Him all on earth below,
    The exhaustless Source of love,
      The great Creator know.

3   He formed the living flame,
      He gave the reasoning mind;
    Then only He may claim
      The worship of mankind.

      Blessed messenger of grace!
    The Eternal is but one,
      No second holds his place.

      Thy goodness never dies.

1   Almighty God! thy wondrous works
      Of providence and grace,
    An angel's perfect mind exceed,
      And all our pride abase.

2   Stupendous heights! amazing depths!
      Creatures in vain explore:
    Or, if a transient glimpse we gain,
      'Tis faint and quickly o'er.

3   Though all the mysteries lie concealed
      Beyond what we can see,
    Grant us the knowledge of ourselves,
      The knowledge, Lord, of thee.

"Whither shall I go from thy presence?"


1   Thou, Lord, by strictest search hast known
    My rising up and lying down;
    My secret thoughts are known to thee,
    Known long before conceived by me.

2   O could I so perfidious be,
    To think of once deserting thee!
    Where, Lord, could I thy influence shun?
    Or whither from thy presence run?

3   If I the morning's wings could gain,
    And fly beyond the western main,
    Thy swifter hand would first arrive,
    And there arrest thy fugitive.

4   Or should I try to shun thy sight
    Beneath the sable wings of night,
    One glance from thee, one piercing ray,
    Would kindle darkness into day.

5   Search, try, O God, my thoughts and heart,
    If mischief lurks in any part;
    Correct me where I go astray,
    And guide me in thy perfect way.

Perfection of God.


1   Thou art, almighty Lord of all,
      From everlasting still the same;
    Before thee dazzling seraphs fall,
      And veil their faces in a flame,
    To see such bright perfections glow--
    Such floods of glory from thee flow.

2   What mortal hand shall dare to paint
      A semblance of thy glory, Lord?
    The brightest rainbow-tints are faint;
      The brightest stars of heaven afford
    But dim effusions of those rays
    Of light that round Jehovah blaze.

3   The sun himself is but a gleam,
      A transient meteor, from thy throne;
    And every frail and fickle beam,
      That ever in creation shone,
    Is nothing, Lord, compared to thee
    In thy own vast immensity.

4   But though thy brightness may create
      All worship from the hosts above,
    What most thy name must elevate
      Is, that thou art a God of love;
    And mercy is the central sun
    Of all thy glories joined in one.

"Canst thou find out the Almighty?"


1   Can creatures to perfection find
    Th' eternal, uncreated Mind?
    Or can the largest stretch of thought
    Measure and search his nature out?

2   God is a King of power unknown;
    Firm are the orders of his throne;
    If he resolve, who dare oppose,
    Or ask him why or what he does?

3   He frowns, and darkness veils the moon
    The fainting sun grows dim at noon:
    The pillars of heaven's starry roof
    Tremble and start at his reproof.

4   These are a portion of his ways:
    But who shall dare describe his face?
    Who can endure his light, or stand
    To hear the thunders of his hand?

    So brilliant here these drops of light--
    There the full ocean rolls--how bright!

2   If night's blue curtain of the sky--
      With thousand stars inwrought,
    Hung like a royal canopy
      With glittering diamonds fraught--
    Be, Lord, thy temple's outer veil,
    What splendor at the shrine must dwell!

3   The dazzling sun, at noon-day hour--
      Forth from his flaming vase
    Flinging o'er earth the golden shower
      Till vale and mountain blaze--
    But shows, O Lord, one beam of thine:
    What, then, the day where thou dost shine?

4   O how shall these dim eyes endure
      That noon of living rays!
    Or how our spirits so impure,
      Upon thy glory gaze!--
    Anoint, O Lord, anoint our sight,
    And fit us for that world of light.

2   On cherubim and seraphim
      Full royally he rode,
    And on the wings of mighty winds
      Came flying all abroad.

    And he, as sovereign Lord and King,
      Forevermore shall reign.

2   Around, within, below, above,
      Wherever space extends,
    There heaven displays its boundless love,
      And power with mercy blends.

3   Then rise, my soul, and sing his name,
      And all his praise rehearse,
    Who spread abroad earth's wondrous frame,
      And built the universe.

4   Where'er thine earthly lot is cast,
      His power and love declare;
    Nor think the mighty theme too vast,
      For God is everywhere.

Providence Mysterious.


1   Thy ways, O Lord, with wise design,
      Are framed upon thy throne above,
    And every dark or bending line
      Meets in the centre of thy love.

2   With feeble light, and half obscure,
      Poor mortals thine arrangements view,
    Not knowing that the least are sure,
      And the mysterious just and true.

3   They neither know nor trace the way;
      But, trusting to thy piercing eye,
    None of their feet to ruin stray,
      Nor shall the weakest fail or die.

4   My favored soul shall meekly learn
      To lay her reason at thy throne;
    Too weak thy secrets to discern,
      I'll trust thee for my guide alone.




GENERAL PRAISE.

Praise to the great Jehovah.


1   Be thou, O God, exalted high;
    And as thy glory fills the sky,
    So let it be on earth displayed,
    Till thou art here, as there, obeyed.

2   O God, our hearts are fixed and bent
    Their thankful tribute to present;
    And, with the heart, the voice, we'll raise
    To thee, our God, in songs of praise.

3   Thy praises, Lord, we will resound
    To all the listening nations round;
    Thy mercy highest heaven transcends;
    Thy truth beyond the clouds extends.

4   Be thou, O God, exalted high;
    And as thy glory fills the sky,
    So let it be on earth displayed,
    Till thou art here, as there, obeyed.

Adoration.


1   Holy, holy, holy Lord,
    Be thy glorious name adored;
    Lord, thy mercies never fail;
    Hail, celestial goodness, hail!

2   Though unworthy, Lord, thine ear,
    Deign our humble songs to hear;
    Purer praise we hope to bring,
    When around thy throne we sing.

3   There no tongue shall silent be;
    All shall join in harmony;
    That, through heaven's capacious round,
    Praise to thee may ever sound.

4   Lord, thy mercies never fail;
    Hail, celestial goodness, hail!
    Holy, holy, holy Lord,
    Be thy glorious name adored.

God Glorious.


1   O, worship the King, all glorious above,
    And gratefully sing his wonderful love,
    Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,
    Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.

2   Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite?
    It breathes in the air, it shines in the light,
    It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,
    And sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.

3   Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,
    In thee do we trust, nor find thee to fail;
    Thy mercies how tender! how firm to the end!
    Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend.

4   Father Almighty, how faithful thy love!
    While angels delight to hymn thee above,
    The humbler creation, though feeble their lays
    With true adoration shall lisp to thy praise.

Invitation to offer Praise.


1   Praise ye the Lord; on every height
      Songs to his glory raise;
    Ye angel hosts, ye stars of night,
      Join in immortal praise.

2   O fire and vapor, hail and snow,
      Ye servants of his will;
    O stormy winds, that only blow
      His mandates to fulfil;--

3   Mountains and rocks, to heaven that rise
      Fair cedars of the wood;
    Creatures of life that wing the skies,
      Or track the plains for food;--

4   Judges of nations; kings, whose hand
      Waves the proud sceptre high;
    O youths and virgins of the land;
      O age and infancy;--

5   Praise ye his name, to whom alone
      All homage should be given,
    Whose glory, from th' eternal throne,
      Spreads wide o'er earth and heaven.

Praise to God.


1   Let us, with a gladsome mind,
    Praise the Lord, for he is kind;
    For his mercies shall endure,
    Ever faithful, ever sure.

2   Let us sound his name abroad,
    For of gods he is the God;
    Who, with all-commanding might,
    Filled the new-made world with light;

3   Caused the golden-tressed sun
    All day long his course to run;
    And the moon to shine by night,
    'Mongst her spangled sisters bright.

4   His own people he did bless,
    In the wasteful wilderness;
    He hath, with a piteous eye,
    Viewed us in our misery.

5   All his creatures he doth feed;
    His full hand supplies their need;
    Let us, therefore, warble forth
    His high majesty and worth.

Praise and Holiness.


1   O render thanks to God above,
    The fountain of eternal love;
    Whose mercy firm through ages past
    Has stood and shall forever last.

2   Who can his mighty deeds express?--
    Not only vast, but numberless!
    What mortal eloquence can raise
    His tribute of immortal praise?

3   Happy are they, and only they,
    Who from thy judgments never stray;
    Who know what's right, nor only so,
    But always practise what they know.

4   Extend to me that favor, Lord,
    Thou to thy chosen dost afford:
    When thou return'st to set them free,
    Let thy salvation visit me.

    God, whose glory fills the sky;
    Peace on earth to man forgiven,
    Man, the well-beloved of Heaven.

2   Favored mortals! raise the song;
    Endless thanks to God belong;
    Hearts o'erflowing with his praise,
    Join the hymns your voices raise.

3   Mark the wonders of his hand!
    Power no empire can withstand;
    Wisdom, angel's glorious theme;
    Goodness, one eternal stream.

4   Awful Being! from thy throne
    Send thy promised blessings down;
    Let thy light, thy truth, thy peace,
    Bid our raging passions cease.

Perpetual Praise.


1   To thee, great Source of light!
      My thankful voice I'll raise;
    And all my powers unite
      To celebrate thy praise;
    And, till my voice is lost in death,
    May praise employ my every breath.

2   And when this feeble tongue
      Lies silent in the dust,
    My soul shall dwell among
      The spirits of the just;
    Then, with the shining hosts above,
    In nobler strains I'll sing thy love.

    Whose glory fills the worlds unknown--
      Praise ye the Lord from Zion's gates.

2   With mingling souls and voices join;
      To him the swelling anthem raise;
    Repeat his name with joy divine,
      And fill the temple with his praise.

3   All-gracious God, to thee we owe
      Each joy and blessing time affords,--
    Light, life, and health, and all below,
      Spring from thy presence, Lord of lords.

4   Thine be the praise, for thine the love
    That freely all our sins forgave,
    Pointed our dying eyes above,
    And showed us life beyond the grave.

2   The wings of every hour shall bear
    Some thankful tribute to thine ear;
    And every setting sun shall see
    New works of duty done for thee.

3   Let distant times and nations raise
    The long succession of thy praise,
    And unborn ages make my song
    The joy and labor of their tongue.

4   But who can speak thy wondrous deeds?
    Thy greatness all our thoughts exceeds
    Vast and unsearchable thy ways:
    Vast and immortal be thy praise.

    Sound his great acts of love,
    While his rich grace we prove,
      Vast as his power.

2   Now let the trumpet raise
    Sounds of triumphant praise
      Wide as his fame;
    There let the harp be found;
    Organs, with solemn sound,
    Roll your deep notes around,
      Filled with his name.

3   While his high praise ye sing,
    Shake every sounding string:
      Sweet the accord!--
    He vital breath bestows:
    Let every breath that flows
    His noblest fame disclose--
      Praise ye the Lord.

2   Let all adore the Lord,

      And praise th' Almighty's name.
    Lo, heaven and earth and seas and skies
    In one melodious concert rise
      To swell th' inspiring theme.

2   Thou heaven of heavens, his vast abode--
    Ye clouds, proclaim your Maker, God;
      Ye thunders, speak his power.
    Lo, on the lightning's rapid wings
    In triumph rides the King of Kings:
      Th' astonished worlds adore.

3   Ye deeps with roaring billows rise
    To join the thunders of the skies--
      Praise him who bids you roll.
    His praise in softer notes declare,
    Each whispering breeze of yielding air,
      And breathe it to the soul.

4   Wake, all ye soaring throngs, and sing;
    Ye cheerful warblers of the spring,
      Harmonious anthems raise
    To him who shaped your finer mould,
    Who tipped your glittering wings with gold,
      And tuned your voice to praise.

5   Let man, by nobler passions swayed,
    The feeling heart, the reasoning head,
      In heavenly praise employ:
    Spread the Creator's name around,
    Till heaven's wide arch repeat the sound--
      The general burst of joy.

      And view with complacence the offering we bring.

3   Be joyful, ye saints sustained by his might,
      And let your glad songs awake with each morn;

2   Jehovah!--'tis a glorious word;
      O may it dwell on every tongue;
    But saints, who best have known the Lord,
      Are bound to raise the noblest song.

2   Man drew from man his birth,
      But God his noble frame

        His sons we are;
          Sheep by him led,
          Preserved and fed
        With tender care.

3   O to his portals press
      In your divine resorts:
    With thanks his power profess,
      And praise him in his courts.

3   Attuned to praise be every voice;
      Let not one heart be sad:
    Jehovah reigns! Let earth rejoice;

    A thousand radiant marks appear,
      Of boundless skill and power divine.

2   From night to day, from day to night,
    The dawning and the dying light
      Lectures of heavenly wisdom read;
    With silent eloquence they raise
    Our thoughts to our Creator's praise,
      And neither sound nor language need.

3   Yet thy divine instructions run
    Far as the journeys of the sun:
      Thy light and truth are known abroad;
    We see thy smile in Nature's face,
    And in the pages of thy grace
      We read the glories of our God.

3   Bear it, ye breezes, on your wings,
      To distant climes away,
    And round the wide-extended world
      The lofty theme convey.

4   Take up the burden of his name,
      Ye clouds, as ye arise,
    To deck with gold the opening morn,
      Or shade the evening skies.

5   Long let it warble round the spheres,
      And echo through the sky;
    Let angels, with immortal skill,
      Improve the harmony;--

6   While we, with sacred rapture fired,
      The blest Creator sing,
    And chant our consecrated lays

    Of the mountain, rock and river,
    Blessed be thy name forever!

2   Thou who slumberest not nor sleepest,
    Blest are they thou kindly keepest.
    God of evening's parting ray,
    Of midnight gloom, and dawning day--
    That rises from the azure sea
    Like breathings of eternity;
    God of life! that fade shall never,
    Blessed be thy name forever!

    Salvation to the world's far ends.

2     Give glory to the Lord,

      His sovereign power record,
        And show his wonders forth,
    Till heathen tongues his grace proclaim,
    And every heart adores his name.

3     'T is he the mountains crowns
        With forests waving wide;
      'T  is he old ocean bounds,
        And heaves her roaring tide;
    He swells the tempests on the main,
    Or breathes the zephyr o'er the plain.

4     Still let the waters roar,
        As round the earth they roll;
      His praise for evermore
        They sound from pole to pole.
    'Tis nature's wild, unconscious song
    O'er thousand waves that floats along.

5     His praise, ye worlds on high,
        Display with all your spheres,
      Amid the darksome sky,
        When silent night appears.

      Benignant, glorious Lord of all!

2   There's beauty in the heat of day;
    There's glory in the noon-tide ray;
      There's sweetness in the twilight shades--
    Magnificence in night. Thy love
    Arch'd the grand heaven of blue above,
      And all our smiling earth pervades.

3   And if thy glories here be found,
    Streaming with radiance all around,
      What must the fount of glory be!
    In thee we'll hope, in thee confide,

      Of all this wondrous world we see;
    Its glow by day, its smile by night,
      Are but reflections caught from thee;
    Where'er we turn, thy glories shine,
    And all things fair and bright are thine.

2   When day, with farewell beam delays
      Among the opening clouds of even,
    And we can almost think we gaze,
      Through opening vistas into heaven,--
    Those hues that mark the sun's decline,
    So soft, so radiant, Lord, are thine.

3   When night, with wings of starry gloom,
      O'ershadows all the earth and skies,
    Like some dark, beauteous bird, whose plume
      Is sparkling with unnumbered eyes,--
    That sacred gloom, those fires divine,
    So grand, so countless, Lord, are thine.

4   When youthful spring around us breathes,
      Thy spirit warms her fragrant sigh;
    And every flower that summer wreathes
      Is born beneath thy kindling eye:
    Where'er we turn, thy glories shine,
    And all things fair and bright are thine.

The Heavens declare the Glory of God.


1   The spacious firmament on high,
    With all the blue ethereal sky,
    And spangled heavens, a shining frame,
    Their great original proclaim.
    Th' unwearied sun, from day to day,
    Doth his Creator's power display;
    And publishes to every land
    The work of an Almighty hand.

2   Soon as the evening shades prevail,
    The moon takes up the wondrous tale,
    And nightly to the listening earth
    Repeats the story of her birth:
    Whilst all the stars which round her burn,
    And all the planets in their turn,
    Confirm the tidings as they roll,
    And spread the truth from pole to pole.

3   What though, in solemn silence, all
    Move round this dark terrestrial ball;
    What though no real voice nor sound
    Amidst their radiant orbs be found;
    In reason's ear they all rejoice,
    And utter forth a glorious voice;
    Forever singing, as they shine,--
    "The hand that made us is divine."

The Creator, God.


1   Lord, when thou said'st, "So let it be,"
      The heavens were spread and shone,
    And this whole earth stood gloriously;
      Thou spak'st and it was done.

2   The whole creation still records,
      Unto this very day,
    That thou art God, the Lord of lords;
      Thee all things must obey.

Nature's Evening Hymn.


1   The heavenly spheres, to thee, O God,
      Attune their evening hymn;
    All wise, all holy, thou art praised,
      In song of seraphim!
    Unnumbered systems, suns and worlds,
      Unite to worship thee,
    While thy majestic greatness fills
      Space, time, eternity.

2   Nature,--a temple worthy thee,
      That beams with light and love;
    Whose flowers so sweetly bloom below,
      Whose stars rejoice above,
    Whose altars are the mountain cliffs
      That rise along the shore;
    Whose anthems, the sublime accord
      Of storm and ocean roar;

3   Her song of gratitude is sung
      By spring's awakening hours;
    Her summer offers at thy shrine
      Its earliest, loveliest flowers;
    Her autumn brings its ripened fruits,
      In glorious luxury given;
    While winter's silver heights reflect
      Thy brightness back to heaven.

4   On all thou smil'st; and what is man
      Before thy presence, God;
    A breath, but yesterday inspired,
      To-morrow but a clod.
    That clod shall mingle in the vale,
      But, kindled, Lord, by thee,
    The spirit to thy arms shall spring,
      To life, to liberty.

1   The heavens, O Lord! thy power proclaim,
    And the earth echoes back thy name;
    Ten thousand voices speak thy might,
    And day to day, and night to night,
    Utter thy praise--thou Lord above!
    Thy praise, thy glory, and thy love.

2   And nature with its countless throng,
    And sun, and moon, and planets' song,
    And every flower that light receives,
    And every dew that tips the leaves,
    And every murmur of the sea--
    Tunes its sweet voice to worship Thee.

3   Thy name thy glories they rehearse,
    Great Spirit of the universe;
    Sense of all sense, and soul of soul,
    Nought is too vast for thy control;
    The meanest and the mightiest share
    Alike thy kindness and thy care.

    How their leaves instruction yield!
    Hark to nature's lesson given
    By the blessed birds of heaven!
    Every bush and tufted tree
    Warbles trust and piety:
    Children, banish doubt and sorrow,--
    God provideth for the morrow.

2   One there lives, whose guardian eye
    Guides our earthly destiny;
    One there lives, who, Lord of all,
    Keeps his children lest they fall:
    Pass we, then, in love and praise,
    Trusting him, through all our days,
    Free from doubt and faithless sorrow,--
    God provideth for the morrow.

Religious Influences of Nature.


1   God of the fair and open sky!
      How gloriously above us springs
    The tented dome, of heavenly blue,
      Suspended on the rainbow's rings!
    Each brilliant star, that sparkles through
      Each gilded cloud that wanders free
    In evening's purple radiance, gives
      The beauty of its praise to thee.

2   God of the rolling orbs above,
      Thy name is written clearly bright
    In the warm day's unvarying blaze,
      Or evening's golden shower of light:
    For every fire that fronts the sun,
      And every spark that walks alone
    Around the utmost verge of heaven,
      Were kindled at thy burning throne.

3   God of the world, the hour must come,
      And nature's self to dust return;
    Her crumbling altars must decay;
      Her incense-fires shall cease to burn;
    But still her grand and lovely scenes
      Have made man's warmest praises flow,
    For hearts grow holier as they trace
      The beauty of the world below.

"Day unto day uttereth speech."


1   The heavens declare his glory,
      Their Maker's skill the skies:
    Each day repeats the story,
      And night to night replies.
    Their silent proclamation
      Throughout the earth is heard;
    The record of creation,
      The page of nature's word.

2   There, from his bright pavilion,
      Like eastern bridegroom clad,
    Hailed by earth's thousand million,
      The sun sets forth; right glad,
    His glorious race commencing,
      The mighty giant seems;
    Through the vast round dispensing
      His all-pervading beams.

3   So pure, so soul-restoring
      Is truth's diviner ray;
    A brighter radiance pouring
      Than all the pomp of day:
    The wanderer surely guiding,
      It makes the simple wise;
    And evermore abiding,
      Unfailing joy supplies.




182.            L. M. 6l.                   Heber.

The Visible World a Shadow of the Invisible.


1   I praised the earth in beauty seen,
    With garlands gay of various green;
    I praised the sea, whose ample field
    Shone glorious as a silver shield;
    And earth and ocean seemed to say,
    "Our beauties are but for a day."

2   I praised the sun, whose chariot rolled
    On wheels of amber and of gold;
    I praised the moon, whose softer eye
    Gleamed sweetly through the summer sky;
    And moon and sun in answer said,
    "Our years are told when we must fade."

3   O God, O, good beyond compare!
    If thus thy meaner works are fair,--
    If thus thy bounties gild the span
    Of sinful earth and mortal man,--
    How glorious must thy mansion be
    Where thy redeemed shall dwell with thee.

Nature a Temple.


1   The turf shall be my fragrant shrine;
    My temple, Lord, that arch of thine,
    My censor's breath the mountain airs,
    And silent thoughts my only prayers.
    My choir shall be the moonlight waves,
    When murmuring homeward to their caves,
    Or when the stillness of the sea,
    E'en more than music breathes of thee.

2   I'll seek, by day, some glade unknown.
    All light and silence like thy throne,
    And the pale stars shall be, at night,
    The only eyes that watch my rite.
    Thy heaven, on which 'tis bliss to look,
    Shall be my pure and shining book,
    Where I can read, in words of flame,
    The glories of thy wondrous name.

3   There's nothing bright, above, below,
    From flowers that bloom, to stars that glow,
    But in its light my soul can see
    Some feature of thy Deity.
    There's nothing dark, below, above,
    But in its gloom I trace thy love,
    And meekly wait that moment, when
    Thy touch shall turn all bright again.




THE SCRIPTURES.




184.              C. M.              Tate & Brady.

Perfection of God's Law.


1   God's perfect law converts the soul,
      Reclaims from false desires;
    With sacred wisdom his sure word
      The ignorant inspires.

2   The statutes of the Lord are just,
      And bring sincere delight;
    His pure commands, in search of truth,
      Assist the feeblest sight.

3   His perfect worship here is fixed,
      On sure foundations laid;
    His equal laws are in the scales
      Of truth and justice weighed.

4   Of more esteem than golden mines,
      Or gold refined with skill;
    More sweet than honey, or the drops
      That from the comb distil.

5   My trusty counsellors they are,
      And friendly warnings give;
    Divine rewards attend on those,
      Who by thy precepts live.




185.              L. M.                     Watts.

Nature and Scripture.  Ps. 19.


1   The heavens declare thy glory, Lord!
      In every star thy wisdom shines;
    But, when our eyes behold thy word,
      We read thy name in fairer lines.

2   The rolling sun, the changing light,
      And nights, and days, thy power confess;
    But the blest volume thou hast writ
      Reveals thy justice and thy grace.

3   Sun, moon, and stars, convey thy praise
      Round the whole earth, and never stand;
    So when thy truth began its race,
      It touched and glanced on every land.

4   Nor shall thy spreading gospel rest
      Till through the world thy truth has run;
    Till Christ has all the nations blest,
      That see the light, or feel the sun.




186.              C. M.                    Cowper.

Light and Glory of the Word.


1   A glory gilds the sacred page,
      Majestic like the sun:
    It gives a light to every age;
      It gives, but borrows none.

2   The hand that gave it still supplies
      The gracious light and heat:
    His truths upon the nations rise;
      They rise, but never set.

3   Let everlasting thanks be thine,
      For such a bright display,
    As makes a world of darkness shine
      With beams of heavenly day.

4   My soul rejoices to pursue
      The steps of Him I love,
    Till glory break upon my view
      In brighter worlds above.




187.            L. M. 6l.    Spirit of the Psalms.

Praise to God for his Word.


1   Join, all ye servants of the Lord,
    To praise him for his sacred word,--
    That word, like manna, sent from heaven,
    To all who seek it freely given;
    Its promises our fears remove,
    And fill our hearts with joy and love.

2   It tells us, though oppressed with cares,
    The God of mercy hears our prayers;
    Though steep and rough th' appointed way,
    His mighty arm shall be our stay;
    Though deadly foes assail our peace,
    His power shall bid their malice cease.

3   It tells who first inspired our breath,
    And who redeemed our souls from death;
    It tells of grace,--grace freely given,--
    And shows the path to God and heaven:
    O, bless we, then, our gracious Lord,
    For all the treasures of his word.

      Declares its Maker, God:
    And all his starry works on high
      Proclaim his power abroad.

2     Ye Christian lands, rejoice!
      Here he reveals his word;
    We are not left to nature's voice
      To bid us know the Lord.

3     His statutes and commands
      Are set before our eyes;
    He puts his gospel in our hands,
      Where our salvation lies.

4     While of thy works I sing,
      Thy glory to proclaim,
    Accept the praise, my God, my King,
      In my Redeemer's name.

The Value of the Scriptures.


1   How precious is the book divine,
      By inspiration given!
    Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine,
      To lead our souls to heaven.

2   O'er all the strait and narrow way
      Its radiant beams are cast;
    A light whose never weary ray
      Grows brightest at the last.

3   It sweetly cheers our fainting hearts
      In this dark vale of tears;
    Life, light, and comfort it imparts,
      And calms our anxious fears.

4   This lamp through all the dreary night
      Of life shall guide our way,
    Till we behold the glorious light
      Of never-ending day.

Sufficiency of the Scriptures.


1   Great God, with wonder and with praise
      On all thy works I look;
    But still thy wisdom, power, and grace,
      Shine brightest in thy book.

2   Here are my choicest treasures hid;
      Here my best comfort lies;
    Here my desires are satisfied;
      And here my hopes arise.

3   Lord, make me understand thy law;
      Show what my faults have been;
    And from thy gospel let me draw
      The pardon of my sin.




191.              S. M.                   Beddome.

Superiority of the Scriptures.


1     O Lord, thy perfect word
      Directs our steps aright;
    Nor can all other books afford
      Such profit or delight.

2     Celestial light it sheds,
      To cheer this vail below;
    To distant lands its glory spreads,
      And streams of mercy flow.

3     True wisdom it imparts;
      Commands our hope and fear;
    O, may we hide it in our hearts,
      And feel its influence there.




192.              L. M.                   Beddome.

The Gospel Revelation.


1   God, in the Gospel of his Son,
    Makes his eternal counsels known;
    'Tis here his richest mercy shines,
    And truth is drawn in fairest lines.

2   Wisdom its dictates here imparts,
    To form our minds, to cheer our hearts;
    Its influence makes the sinner live;
    It bids the drooping saint revive.

3   Our raging passions it controls,
    And comfort yields to contrite souls;
    It brings a better world in view,
    And guides us all our journey through.

4   May this blest volume ever lie
    Close to my heart, and near my eye,
    Till life's last hour my soul engage,
    And be my chosen heritage.

Revelation.  Ps. 119.


1   Let all the heathen writers join
      To form one perfect book,
    Great God, if once compared with thine,
      How mean their writings look!

2   Not the most perfect rules they gave
      Could show one sin forgiven,
    Nor lead a step beyond the grave;
      But thine conduct to heaven.

3   I've seen an end of what we call
      Perfection here below;
    How short the powers of nature fall,
      And can no farther go!

4   Our faith, and love, and every grace,
      Fall far below thy word;
    But perfect truth and righteousness
      Dwell only with the Lord.

    Light of our way! whose ways are flung
      In mercy o'er our pilgrim road,
    How blessed, its dark shades among,
      The star that guides us to our God.

2   In the sweet morning's hour of prime,
      Thy blessed words our lips engage,
    And round our hearths at evening time
      Our children spell the holy page;
    The waymark through long distant years,
      To guide their wandering footsteps on,
    Till thy last loveliest beam appears,
      Inscribed upon the churchyard stone.

3   Lamp of our feet! which day by day
      Are passing to the quiet tomb,
    If on it fall thy peaceful ray,
      Our last low dwelling hath no gloom.
    How beautiful their calm repose

    Whose pilgrimage on earth is closed

2   I'll read the histories of thy love,
      And keep thy laws in sight,
    While through the promises I rove,
      With ever-fresh delight.

3   'T is a broad land of wealth unknown,
      Where springs of life arise,
    Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,
      And hidden glory lies.

4   The best relief that mourners have,
      It makes our sorrows blest;

      It is Love's blessed band,
      That reaches from the throne
    To him--whoe'er he be--whose hand
      Will seize it for his own!

2     It is the golden key
      Unto celestial wealth,
    Joy to the sons of poverty,
      And to the sick man, health!
      The gently proffer'd aid
      Of one who knows and best
    Supplies the beings he has made
      With what will make them blessed.

3     It is the sweetest sound
      That infant years can hear,
    Travelling across that holy ground,
      With God and angels near.
      There rests the weary head,
      There age and sorrow go;
    And how it smooths the dying bed,
      O! let the Christian show!

      I place supreme delight.

2   On him in rich effusion poured,
      My spirit shall descend;
    My truth and judgment he shall show
      To earth's remotest end.

3   Gentle and still shall be his voice;
      No threats from him proceed;
    The smoking flax shall he not quench,
      Nor break the bruised reed.

4   The feeble spark to flames he'll raise;
      The weak will not despise;
    Judgment he shall bring forth to truth,
      And make the fallen rise.

5   The progress of his zeal and power
      Shall never know decline,
    Till foreign lands and distant isles
      Receive the law divine.

2   Bring down the proud mountain though towering to heaven,
      And be the low valley exalted on high;
    The rough path and crooked be made smooth and even,
      For, Zion! your King, your Redeemer is nigh.

2   Watchman! tell us of the night;

    Traveller! blessedness and light,
      Peace and truth its course portends.
    Watchman! will its beams alone
      Gild the spot that gave them birth?
    Traveller! ages are its own;
      See, it bursts o'er all the earth.

3   Watchman! tell us of the night,
      For the morning seems to dawn.
    Traveller! darkness takes its flight;
      Doubt and terror are withdrawn.

    Souls redeemed and sins forgiven:--
      Loud our golden harps shall sound.

4   "Christ is born, the great Anointed;
      Heaven and earth his praises sing!
    O, receive whom God appointed,
      For your Prophet, Priest and King."

5   Let us learn the wondrous story
      Of our great Redeemer's birth;
    Spread the brightness of his glory,
      Till it cover all the earth.

Christmas Hymn.


1   Calm on the listening ear of night
      Come heaven's melodious strains,
    Where wild Judea stretches far
      Her silver-mantled plains!

2   The answering hills of Palestine
      Send back the glad reply;
    And greet, from all their holy heights,
      The dayspring from on high

3   O'er the blue depths of Galilee
      There comes a holier calm,
    And Sharon waves, in solemn praise,
      Her silent groves of palm.

4   "Glory to God!" the sounding skies
      Loud with their anthems ring,--
    Peace to the earth,--good-will to men,
      From heaven's eternal King!"

5   Light on thy hills, Jerusalem!
      The Saviour now is born!
    And bright on Bethlehem's joyous plains
      Breaks the first Christmas morn.

1     Hark! hark! with harps of gold,
      What anthem do they sing?--
    The radiant clouds have backward rolled,
      And angels smite the string.
      "Glory to God!"--bright wings
      Spread glist'ning and afar,
    And on the hallowed rapture rings
      From circling star to star.

2     "Glory to God!" repeat
      The glad earth and the sea;
    And every wind and billow fleet,
      Bears on the jubilee.
      Where Hebrew bard hath sung,
      Or Hebrew seer hath trod,
    Each holy spot has found a tongue;
      "Let glory be to God."

3     Soft swells the music now
      Along that shining choir,
    And every seraph bends his brow
      And breathes above his lyre.
      What words of heavenly birth
      Thrill deep our hearts again,
    And fall like dew-drops to the earth?
      "Peace and good-will to men!"

4     Soft!--yet the soul is bound
      With rapture, like a chain:
    Earth, vocal, whispers them around,
      And heav'n repeats the strain.
      Sound, harps, and hail the morn
      With ev'ry golden string;--
    For unto us this day is born
      A Saviour and a King!

1     No loud avenging voice
        Proclaimed Messiah's birth;
      The Son of God came down to teach
        Humility on earth,
    And by his sufferings to efface
    The errors of a sinful race.

2     Not on a purple throne,
        With gold and jewels crowned,
      But in the meanest dwelling place
        The precious babe was found:
    Yet star-directed sages came,
    And kneeling, glorified his name.

3     To shepherds first was shown
        The promised boon of heaven,
      Who cried, "To us a child is born--
        To us a Son is given!"
    Death from his mighty throne was hurled,
    Faith hailed Salvation to the world.

4     Lord! may thy holy cross
        Bear peace from clime to clime,
      Till all mankind at length are freed
        From sorrow, shame and crime:
    Dispel the unbeliever's gloom,
    And end the terrors of the tomb!

1   When Jordan hushed his waters still,
    And silence slept on Zion's hill;
    When Bethlehem's shepherds through the night
    Watched o'er their flocks by starry light:

2   Hark! from the midnight hills around,
    A voice of more than mortal sound,
    In distant hallelujahs stole,
    Wild murm'ring o'er the raptured soul.

3   "O Zion! lift thy raptured eye,
    The long expected hour is nigh;
    The joys of nature rise again,
    The Prince of Salem comes to reign.

4   "He comes, to cheer the trembling heart,
    Bids Satan and his host depart;
    Again the day-star gilds the gloom,
    Again the bowers of Eden bloom."

      And heavenly peace on earth;
    Good-will to men, to angels joy,

          The golden lyre,
          And vocal choir,
        The concert swell.

2   Angelic hosts descend,
      With harmony divine;
    See, how from heaven they bend,
      And in full chorus join!
        "Fear not," say they;

        Is born to day."

3   "Glory to God on high!
      Ye mortals, spread the sound,

      Chanted, at the wondrous birth,
    "Glory be to God on high,
      Peace--good-will to man on earth."

3   Join we then our feeble lays
      To the chorus of the sky;
    And, in songs of grateful praise,
      Glory give to God on high.

Star of the East.


1   Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,
      Dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid;
    Star of the East,--the horizon adorning,--
      Guide where the infant Redeemer is laid.

2   Cold on his cradle the dew-drops are shining;
      Low lies his head with the beasts of the stall;
    Angels bend o'er him, in slumber reclining,--
      Monarch, Redeemer, Restorer of all.

3   Say, shall we yield him in costly devotion,
      Odors of Edom, and offerings divine?
    Gems of the mountain, and pearls of the ocean,
      Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine?

4   Vainly we offer each ample oblation,
      Vainly with gold would his favor secure;
    Richer by far is the heart's adoration,
      Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.

5   Brightest and best of the sons of the morning,
      Dawn on our darkness and lend us thine aid;
    Star of the East,--the horizon adorning,--
      Guide where the infant Redeemer is laid.

Christ's Birth.


1   Arrayed in clouds of golden light,
      More bright than heaven's effulgent bow,
    Jehovah's angel came by night,
      To bless the sleeping world below.
    How soft the music of his tongue!
    How sweet the hallowed strains he sung!

2   Good-will henceforth to man be given,
      The light of glory beams on earth:
    Let angels tune the harps of heaven,
      And saints rejoice in Shiloh's birth;
    In him all nations shall be blest,
    And his shall be a glorious rest.

Christmas Hymn.


1   O, let your mingling voices rise,
    In grateful rapture, to the skies,
      And hail a Saviour's birth:
    Let songs of joy the day proclaim,
    When Jesus all-triumphant came
      To bless the sons of earth.

2   He came to bid the weary rest,
    To heal the sinner's wounded breast,
      To bind the broken heart,
    To spread the light of truth around,
    And to the world's remotest bound
      The heavenly gift impart.

3   He came our trembling souls to save
    From sin, from sorrow, and the grave,
      And chase our fears away;
    Victorious over death and time,
    To lead us to a happier clime,
      Where reigns eternal day.

      The Saviour promised long!
    Let every heart prepare a throne,
      And every voice a song.

2   On him the Spirit largely poured,
      Exerts its sacred fire;
    Wisdom and might, and zeal and love,
      His holy breast inspire.

3   He comes, from thickest films of vice
      To clear the mental ray;
    And on the eye-balls of the blind
      To pour celestial day.

4   He comes, the broken heart to bind,
      The bleeding soul to cure;
    And with the treasure of his grace
      Enrich the humble poor.

5   Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace!
      Thy welcome shall proclaim;
    And heaven's eternal arches ring
      With thy beloved name.

    While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
      Repeat the sounding joy.

3   No more let sins and sorrows grow,
      Nor thorns infest the ground;
    He comes to make his blessings flow
      As far as sin is found.

4   He rules the world with truth and grace,
      And makes the nations prove
    The glories of his righteousness,
      And wonders of his love.

    The herald which the Prince of Peace
      Sent to prepare his ways.

2   "Behold the Lamb of God," he cries,
      "That takes our guilt away;
    I saw the Spirit o'er his head,
      On his baptizing day.

3   "Be every vale exalted high,
      Sink every mountain low;
    The proud must stoop, and humble souls
      Shall his salvation know.

4   "Behold the Morning Star arise,
      Ye that in darkness sit;
    He marks the path that leads to peace,
      And guides our doubtful feet."

    And hear the sacred voice from heaven
      That bids us all attend.

2   "This is my well-beloved Son,"
      Proclaimed the voice divine;
    "Hear him," his heavenly Father said,
      "For all his words are mine."

3   His mission thus confirmed from heaven,
      The great Messiah came,
    And heavenly wisdom showed to man
      In God his Father's name.

4   The path of heavenly peace he showed
      That leads to bliss on high;
    Where all his faithful followers here
      Shall live, no more to die.

      The chosen of the Lord,
    God's well-beloved Son, fulfils
      The sure prophetic word.

2     No royal pomp adorns
      This King of righteousness:
    Meekness and patience, truth and love,
      Compose his princely dress.

3     The spirit of the Lord,
      In rich abundance shed,
    On this great Prophet gently lights,
      And rests upon his head.

4     Jesus, the light of men,
      His doctrine life imparts;
    O, may we feel its quickening power
      To warm and glad our hearts.

5     Cheered by its beams, our souls
      Shall run the heavenly way;
    The path which Christ has marked and trod,
      Will lead to endless day.

1   How sweetly flowed the gospel's sound
      From lips of gentleness and grace,
    When listening thousands gathered round,
      And joy and reverence filled the place!

2   From heaven he came--of heaven he spoke
      To heaven he led his followers' way;
    Dark clouds of gloomy night he broke,
      Unveiling an immortal day.

3   "Come, wanderers, to my Father's home,
      Come, all ye weary ones, and rest!"
    Yes! sacred teacher,--we will come--
      Obey thee, love thee, and be blest!

4   Decay, then, tenements of dust!
      Pillars of earthly pride, decay!
    A nobler mansion waits the just,
      And Jesus has prepared the way.

Miracles of Christ.


1   On eyes that never saw the day
    Christ pours the bright celestial ray;
    And deafened ears, by him unbound,
    Catch all the harmony of sound.

2   Lameness takes up its bed, and goes
    Rejoicing in the strength that flows
    Through every nerve; and, free from pain,
    Pours forth to God the grateful strain.

3   The shattered mind his word restores,
    And tunes afresh the mental powers;
    The dead revive, to life return,
    And bid affection cease to mourn.

4   Canst thou, my soul, these wonders trace,
    And not admire Jehovah's grace?
    Canst thou behold thy Prophet's power,
    And not the God he served adore?

"That ye through his poverty might be rich."


1   O'er the dark wave of Galilee
      The gloom of twilight gathers fast,
    And on the waters drearily
      Descends the fitful evening blast.

2   The weary bird hath left the air,
      And sunk into his sheltered nest;
    The wandering beast has sought his lair,
      And laid him down to welcome rest.

3   Still, near the lake, with weary tread,
      Lingers a form of human kind;
    And on his lone, unsheltered head,
      Flows the chill night-damp of the wind.

4   Why seeks he not a home of rest?
      Why seeks he not a pillowed bed?
    Beasts have their dens, the bird its nest;
      He hath not where to lay his head.

5   Such was the lot he freely chose,
      To bless, to save the human race;
    And through his poverty there flows
      A rich, full stream of heavenly grace.

"Peace! be still!"


1   Fear, was within the tossing bark,
      When stormy winds grew loud,
    And waves came rolling high and dark,
      And the tall mast was bowed.

2   And men stood breathless in their dread,
      And baffled in their skill--
    But One was there, who rose and said
      To the wild sea, "Be still!"

3   And the wind ceased; it ceased! that word
      Passed through the gloomy sky,
    The troubled billows knew their Lord,
      And sank beneath his eye.

4   Thou that didst rule the angry hour,
      And tame the tempest's mood--
    Oh! send, thy Spirit forth in power
      O'er our dark souls to brood!

5   Thou that didst bow the billows' pride,
      Thy mandates to fulfil--
    Speak, speak to passion's raging tide,
      Speak and say--"Peace, be still!"

The Pool of Bethesda.


1   Around Bethesda's healing wave
      Waiting to hear the rustling wing,
    Which spoke the angel nigh, who gave
      Its virtue to that holy spring,
    With patience, and with hope endued
    Were seen the gathered multitude.

2   Had they who watched and waited there
      Been conscious who was passing by,
    With what unceasing anxious care
      Would they have sought his pitying eye;
    And craved with fervency of soul,
    His Power Divine to make them whole!

3   Bethesda's pool has lost its power!
      No angel, by his glad descent,
    Dispenses that diviner dower
      Which with its healing waters went.
    But he, whose word surpassed its wave,
    Is still omnipotent to save.

The Holy Guest.


1   Messiah Lord! who, wont to dwell
    In lowly shape and cottage cell,
    Didst not refuse a guest to be
    At Cana's poor festivity.

2   O when our soul from care is free,
    Then, Saviour, would we think on thee;
    And, seated at the festal board,
    In fancy's eye behold the Lord.

3   Then may we seem, in fancy's ear,
    Thy manna-dropping tongue to hear,
    And think,--"if now his searching view
    Each secret of our spirit knew!"

4   So may such joy, chastised and pure,
    Beyond the bounds of earth endure;
    Nor pleasure in the wounded mind
    Shall leave a rankling sting behind.




223.              C. M.                    Cowper.

"He steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem."


1   The Saviour, what a noble flame,
      Was kindled in his breast,
    When hasting to Jerusalem,
      He marched before the rest!

2   Good-will to men, and zeal for God,
      His every thought engross;
    He goes to be baptized with blood;
      He goes to meet the cross.

3   With all his sufferings full in view,
      And woes to us unknown,
    Forth to the task his spirit flew;
      'Twas love that urged him on.

4   And while his holy sorrows here
      Engage our wondering eyes,
    We learn our lighter cross to bear,
      And hasten to the skies.

    In lowly pomp ride on to die!
    O Christ, thy triumphs now begin,
    O'er captive death and conquered sin.

3   Ride on, ride on in majesty!
    The winged squadrons of the sky
    Look down with sad and wondering eyes,
    To see the approaching sacrifice.

4   Ride on, ride on in majesty!
    Thy last and fiercest strife is nigh;
    The Father on his glorious throne
    Expects his own anointed Son!

      Receive his last commands.

2   "Blest is the man whose softening heart
      Feels all another's pain;
    To whom the supplicating eye
      Was never raised in vain;

3   "Peace from the bosom of his God,
      My peace to him I give;
    And when he kneels before his throne,
      His trembling soul shall live.

    Descend on those who thus fulfil
      The perfect law of love."

The Agony in Gethsemane.


1     He knelt; the Saviour knelt and prayed,
        When but his Father's eye
      Looked, through the lonely garden's shade,
        On that dread agony:
    The Lord of high and heavenly birth
    Was bowed with sorrow unto death.

2     He knew them all,--the doubt, the strife,
        The faint perplexing dread;
      The mists that hang o'er parting life
        All darkened round his head;
    And the Deliverer knelt to pray;
    Yet passed it not, that cup, away.

3     It passed not, though the stormy wave
        Had sunk beneath his tread;
      It passed not, though to him the grave
        Had yielded up its dead;
    But there was sent him, from on high,
    A gift of strength, for man to die.

4     And was his mortal hour beset
        With anguish and dismay?
      How may we meet our conflict yet
        In the dark, narrow way?
    How, but through him that path who trod?
    "Save, or we perish, Son of God."

1   The morning dawns upon the place,
      Where Jesus spent the night in prayer;
    Through brightening glooms behold his face,
      No form or comeliness is there.

2   Last eve by those he called his own,
      Betrayed, forsaken or denied,
    He met his enemies alone,
      In all their malice, rage, and pride.

3   But hark! he prays;--'tis for his foes;
      He speaks;--'tis comfort to his friends;
    Answers;--and Paradise bestows;
      "'Tis finished!"--here the conflict ends.

4   "Truly, this was the Son of God!"
      --Though in a servant's mean disguise,
    And bruised beneath the Father's rod,
      Not for himself,--for man he dies.

    'T is midnight; in the garden, now,
      The suffering Saviour prays alone.

2   'T is midnight; and from all removed,
      The Saviour wrestles lone, with fears;
    E'en that disciple whom he loved
      Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.

3   'T is midnight; and for others' guilt
      The man of sorrows weeps in blood;
    Yet he that hath in anguish knelt
      Is not forsaken by his God.

4   'T is midnight; from celestial plains
      Is borne the song that angels know;
    Unheard by mortals are the strains
      That sweetly soothe the Saviour's woe.

Agony in the Garden.


1   Dark was the night and cold the ground
      On which the Lord was laid;
    His sweat like drops of blood ran down;
      In agony he prayed,--

2   "Father, remove this bitter cup,
      If such thy sacred will;
    If not, content to drink it up,
      Thy pleasure I fulfil."

3   Go to the garden, sinner; see
      Those precious drops that flow;
    The heavy load he bore for thee;
      For thee he lies so low.

4   Then learn of him the cross to bear;
      Thy Father's will obey;
    And, when temptations press thee near,
      Awake to watch and pray.

Christ our Example in Sufferings.


1     Go to dark Gethsemane,
        Ye that feel temptation's power,
      Your Redeemer's conflict see,
        Watch with him one bitter hour.
    Turn not from his griefs away,
    Learn of Jesus Christ to pray.

2     Follow to the judgment-hall,
        View the Lord of life arraigned:
      O the wormwood and the gall!
        O the pangs his soul sustained!
    Shun not suffering, shame or loss;
    Learn of him to bear the cross.

3     Calvary's mournful mountain climb;
        There, admiring at his feet,
      Mark that miracle of time,
        God's own sacrifice complete:
    "It is finished," hear him cry;
    Learn of Jesus Christ to die.

4     Early hasten to the tomb
        Where they laid his breathless clay;
      All is solitude and gloom;
        --Who has taken him away?
    Christ is risen; he meets our eyes--
    Saviour, teach us so to rise.

The Crucifixion of Christ.


1   Behold the Saviour on the cross,
      A spectacle of woe!
    See from his agonizing wounds
      The blood incessant flow;

2   Till death's pale ensigns o'er his cheek
      And trembling lips were spread;
    Till light forsook his closing eyes,
      And life his drooping head.

3   'Tis finished--the Messiah dies
      For sins, but not his own;
    The great redemption is complete,
      And death is overthrown.

4   'Tis finished--ritual worship ends,
      And Gospel ages run;
    All old things now are past away,
      A new world is begun.

A Dying Saviour.


1   Stretched on the cross, the Saviour dies,
    Hark! his expiring groans arise;
    See, from his hands, his feet, his side,
    Descends the sacred, crimson tide.

2   And didst thou bleed?--for sinners bleed?
    And could the sun behold the deed?
    No; he withdrew his cheering ray,
    And darkness veiled the mourning day.

3   Can I survey this scene of woe,
    Where mingling grief and mercy flow,
    And yet my heart so hard remain,--
    Unmoved by either love or pain!

4   Come, dearest Lord, thy grace impart,
    To warm this cold, this stupid heart,
    Till all its powers and passions move,
    In melting grief and ardent love.

1   "'T is finished!"--so the Saviour cried,
    And meekly bowed his head and died:
    "'T is finished!"--yes, the race is run,
    The battle fought, the victory won.

2   "'T is finished!"--all that heaven foretold
    By prophets in the days of old;
    And truths are opened to our view,
    That kings and prophets never knew.

3   "'T is finished!"--Son of God, thy power
    Hath triumphed in this awful hour;
    And yet our eyes with sorrow see
    That life to us was death to thee.

4   "'T is finished!"--let the joyful sound
    Be heard through all the nations round;
    "'Tis finished!"--let the triumph rise,
    And swell the chorus of the skies.

1   He dies! the Friend of sinners dies!
      Lo, Salem's daughters weep around!
    A solemn darkness veils the skies!
      A sudden trembling shakes the ground!

2   Come, saints, and drop a tear or two
      For him who groaned beneath your load!
    He shed a thousand drops for you--
      A thousand drops of richest blood!

3   Here's love and grief beyond degree;
      The Lord of glory dies for men;--
    But lo, what sudden joys we see!
      Jesus, the dead, revives again!

4   The rising Lord forsakes the tomb--
      The tomb in vain forbids his rise;
    Cherubic legions guard him home,
      And shout him welcome to the skies!

1   Angels, roll the rock away;
    Death, yield up thy mighty prey;
    See! he rises from the tomb,
    Glowing with immortal bloom.

2   'T is the Saviour! Angels, raise
    Fame's eternal trump of praise;
    Let the earth's remotest bound
    Hear the joy-inspiring sound.

3   Now, ye saints, lift up your eyes;
    Now to glory see him rise
    In long triumph up the sky--
    Up to waiting worlds on high.

4   Praise him, all ye heavenly choirs,
    Praise, and sweep your golden lyres;
    Shout, O earth, in rapturous song;
    Let the strains be sweet and strong.

5   Every note with wonder swell,--
    And the Saviour's triumph tell;
    Where, O death, is now thy sting?
    Where thy terrors, vanquished king?

    Day of triumph through the skies,
    See the glorious Saviour rise!

2   Christians, dry your flowing tears;
    Chase those unbelieving fears;
    Look on his deserted grave;
    Doubt no more his power to save.

3   Ye who are of death afraid,
    Triumph in the scattered shade;
    Drive your anxious fears away;
    See the place where Jesus lay.

4   So the rising sun appears,
    Shedding radiance o'er the spheres;
    So returning beams of light
    Chase the terrors of the night.

      To God the sovereign King!
    Let every land their tongues employ,
      And hymns of triumph sing.

2   Jesus, our God, ascends on high;
      His heavenly guards around
    Attend him rising through the sky,
      With trumpet's joyful sound.

3   While angels shout and praise their King,
      Let mortals learn their strains;
    Let all the earth his honors sing;
      O'er all the earth he reigns.

4   Speak forth his praise with awe profound;
      Let knowledge guide the song;
    Nor mock him with a solemn sound
      Upon a thoughtless tongue.

Example of Christ.


1   My dear Redeemer, and my Lord,
    I read my duty in thy word:
    But in thy life the law appears,
    Drawn out in living characters.

2   Such was thy truth, and such thy zeal,
    Such deference to thy Father's will,
    Such love, and meekness so divine,
    I would transcribe, and make them mine.

3   Cold mountains, and the midnight air,
    Witnessed the fervor of thy prayer,
    The desert thy temptations knew,
    Thy conflict, and thy victory, too.

4   Be thou my pattern; may I bear
    More of thy gracious image here;
    Then God, the Judge, shall own my name
    Among the followers of the Lamb.

1   Behold, where, in a mortal form,
      Appears each grace divine;
    The virtues, all in Jesus met,
      With mildest radiance shine.

2   To spread the rays of heavenly light,
      To give the mourner joy,
    To preach glad tidings to the poor,
      Was his divine employ.

3   'Midst keen reproach and cruel scorn,
      Patient and meek he stood;
    His foes, ungrateful, sought his life;
      He labored for their good.

4   In the last hour of deep distress,
      Before his Father's throne,
    With soul resigned, he bowed, and said,
      "Thy will, not mine, be done!"

5   Be Christ our pattern and our guide!
      His image may we bear!
    O, may we tread his holy steps,
      His joy and glory share!

Excellency of Christ.


1   O, could we speak the matchless worth,
    O, could we sound the glories forth,
      Which in our Saviour shine,
    We'd soar, and touch the heavenly strings,
    And vie with Gabriel, while he sings,
      In notes almost divine.

2   We'd sing the characters he bears,
    And all the forms of love he wears,
      Exalted on his throne:
    In loftiest songs of sweetest praise,
    We would, to everlasting days,
      Make all his glories known.

3   O, the delightful day will come,
    When Christ our Lord will bring us home
      And we shall see his face;
    Then, with our Saviour, Brother, Friend,
    A blest eternity we'll spend,
      Triumphant in his grace.

Christ's Submission to his Father's Will.


1   "Father divine," the Saviour cried,
    While horrors pressed on every side,
    And prostrate on the ground he lay,
    "Remove this bitter cup away.

2   "But if these pangs must still be borne
    Or helpless man be left forlorn,
    I bow my soul before thy throne,
    And say, Thy will, not mine, be done."

3   Thus our submissive souls would bow,
    And, taught by Jesus, lie as low;
    Our hearts, and not our lips alone,
    Would say, Thy will, not ours, be done.

4   Then, though like him in dust we lie,
    We'll view the blissful moment nigh,
    Which, from our portion in his pains,
    Calls to the joy in which he reigns.

"Greater love hath no man than this."


1   "See how he loved!" exclaimed the Jews,
      As tender tears from Jesus fell;
    My grateful heart the thought pursues,
      And on the theme delights to dwell.

2   See how he loved, who travelled on,
      Teaching the doctrine from the skies;
    Who bade disease and pain be gone,
      And called the sleeping dead to rise.

3   See how he loved, who never shrank
      From toil or danger, pain or death;
    Who all the cup of sorrow drank,
      And meekly yielded up his breath.

4   Such love can we unmoved survey?
      O may our breasts with ardor glow,
    To tread his steps, his laws obey,
      And thus our warm affections show.

      Amid this starless waste of woe
    To find a pathway to the skies,
      A light from heaven's eternal glow--
    By thee must come, thou Gate of love,
      Through which the saints undoubting trod,
    Till faith discovers, like the dove,
      An ark, a resting-place in God.

2   Thou art the Truth--whose steady day
      Shines on through earthly blight and bloom,
    The pure, the everlasting ray,
      The lamp that shines e'en in the tomb;
    The light that out of darkness springs,
      And guideth those that blindly go;
    The word whose precious radiance flings
      Its lustre upon all below.

3   Thou art the Life--the blessed well,
      With living waters gushing o'er,
    Which those that drink shall ever dwell
      Where sin and thirst are known no more.
    Thou art the mystic pillar given,
      Our lamp by night, our light by day;
    Thou art the sacred bread from heaven;
      Thou art the Life--the Truth--the Way.

      In him all glories meet;
    He is a shade above our heads,
      A light to guide our feet.

3   When storms arise and tempests blow,
      He speaks the stilling word;
    The threatening billows cease to flow,
      The winds obey their Lord.

4   The thickest clouds are soon dispersed,
      If Jesus shows his face;
    To weary, heavy-laden souls
      He is the resting-place.

    Behold the Father's chief delight
      Expire in agony!

2     For whom, for whom, my heart,
      Were all these sorrows borne?
    Why did he feel that piercing smart,
      And meet that cruel scorn?

3     For love of us he bled,
      And all in torture died;
    'T was love that bowed his fainting head,
      And oped his gushing side.

4     In him our hearts unite,
      Nor share his grief alone,
    But from his cross pursue their flight
      To his triumphant throne.

THE GOSPEL, AND ITS INVITATIONS.




257.              C. M.                     Watts.

The Gospel Trumpet.


1   Let every mortal ear attend,
      And every heart rejoice;
    The trumpet of the Gospel sounds
      With an inviting voice.

2   Ho! all ye hungry, starving souls,
      That feed upon the wind,
    And vainly strive with earthly toys
      To fill an empty mind,--

3   Eternal Wisdom has prepared
      A soul-reviving feast,
    And bids your longing appetites
      The rich provision taste.

4   Ho! ye that pant for living streams,
      And pine away and die,--
    Here you may quench your raging thirst
      With springs that never dry.

5   The happy gates of gospel grace
      Stand open night and day;
    Lord, we are come to seek supplies,
      And drive our wants away.




258.              C. M.                    Cowper.

"The entrance of thy Word giveth Light."


1   How blest thy creature is, O God,
      When, with a single eye,
    He views the lustre of thy word,
      The day-spring from on high!

2   Through all the storms that veil the skies,
      And frown on earthly things,
    The Sun of Righteousness doth rise,
      With healing on his wings.

3   The soul, a dreary province once
      Of Satan's dark domain,
    Feels a new empire formed within,
      And owns a heavenly reign.

4   The glorious orb, whose golden beams
      The fruitful year control,
    Since first, obedient to thy word,
      He started from the goal,--

5   Has cheered the nations with the joys
      His orient rays impart:
    But, Jesus, 'tis thy light alone
      Can shine upon the heart.




259.              L. M.                     Watts.

Gospel Invitations.


1   "Come hither, all ye weary souls,
      Ye heavy-laden sinners, come!
    I'll give you rest from all your toils,
      And raise you to my heavenly home.

2   "They shall find rest that learn of me;
      I'm of a meek and lowly mind,
    But passion rages like the sea,
      And pride is restless as the wind.

3   "Blest is the man whose shoulders take
      My yoke, and bear it with delight;
    My yoke is easy to his neck,
      My grace shall make the burden light."

4   Jesus, we come at thy command;
      With faith, and hope, and humble zeal,
    Resign our spirits to thy hand
      To mould and guide us at thy will.




260.              L. M.                     Watts.

God's Glory in the Gospel.


1   Now to the Lord a noble song!
    Awake, my soul, awake, my tongue;
    Hosanna, to the Eternal name,
    And all his boundless love proclaim.

2   The spacious earth and spreading flood
    Proclaim the wise, the powerful God;
    And thy rich glories from afar
    Sparkle in every rolling star.

3   But in the Gospel of thy Son
    Are all thy mightiest works outdone;
    The light it pours upon our eyes
    Outshines the wonders of the skies.

4   Our spirits kindle in its beam;
    It is a sweet, a glorious theme;
    Ye angels, dwell upon the sound;
    Ye heavens, reflect it to the ground.

The Jubilee Proclaimed.


1   Blow ye the trumpet, blow,
      The gladly solemn sound;
    Let all the nations know,
      To earth's remotest bound,
    The year of jubilee is come;
    Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.

2   The gospel trumpet hear,
      The news of pardoning grace:
    Ye happy souls, draw near;
      Behold your Saviour's face:
    The year of jubilee is come;
    Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.

3   Jesus, our great High Priest,
      Has full assurance made;
    Ye weary spirits, rest;
      Ye mourning souls, be glad:
    The year of jubilee is come;
    Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.

Gospel Call to the Church.


1   Praise to God, the great Creator,
      Bounteous Source of every joy,
    He whose hand upholds all nature,
      He whose word can all destroy!
    Saints with pious zeal attending,
      Now the grateful tribute raise;
    Solemn songs, to heaven ascending,
      Join the universal praise.

2   Here indulge each grateful feeling;
      Lowly bend with contrite souls;
    Here, his milder grace revealing,
      Here no peal of thunder rolls:
    Lo, the sacred page before us
      Bears the promise of his love,
    Full of mercy to restore us,
      Mercy beaming from above.

3   Every secret fault confessing,
      Deed unrighteous, thought of sin,
    Seize, O seize the proffered blessing,
      Grace from God, and peace within!
    Heart and voice with rapture swelling,
      Still the song of glory raise;
    On the theme immortal dwelling,
      Join the universal praise.

The Gospel Advancing.


1   Brighter shines the gospel day
      On our Zion's mountains;
    Clearer has become the way
      To her living fountains.
    Hark! the stirring trumpet tone
    Hath o'er every hill-top flown;
    Error's hosts retiring see!
    Superstition's minions flee!

2   From the luring haunts of sin
      Where the soul is blighted,
    Christ invites--come enter in
      To the temple lighted
    With the beams of pardoning love--
    With the wisdom from above;
    Leave the woes of sin behind,
    And a rest perpetual find.

3   Come from error's hoary shrine,
      Jew or Gentile seeking
    For the way of life divine--
      Hear this voice now speaking!
    Willing hearts and hands prepare
    Christ's redeeming grace to share;
    Join our triumph-strain, and sing
    Zion's Universal King.

The Fountain of Living Waters.


1   O, what amazing words of grace
      Are in the gospel found!
    Suited to every sinner's case,
      Who hears the joyful sound.

2   Come, then, with all your wants and wounds;
      Your every burden bring;
    Here love, unchanging love, abounds,
      A deep, celestial spring.

3   This spring with living water flows,
      And heavenly joy imparts;
    Come, thirsty souls, your wants disclose,
      And drink with thankful hearts.

Now is the Day of Grace.


1     Now is the day of grace;
      Now to the Father come;
    The Lord is calling, "Seek my face,
      And I will guide you home."

2     The Saviour bids you speed;
      O, wherefore then delay?
    He calls in love; he sees your need;
      He bids you come to-day.

3     To-day the prize is won;
      The promise is to save;
    Then, O, be wise; to-morrow's sun
      May shine upon your grave.

Invitation to the Gospel Feast.


1   Ye wretched, hungry, starving poor,
      Behold a royal feast,
    Where mercy spreads her bounteous store,
      For every humble guest!

2   See, Jesus stands with open arms!
      He calls, he bids you come;--
    Guilt holds you back, and fear alarms,--
      But see, there yet is room!

3   Come then, and with his people taste
      The blessings of his love;
    While hope attends the sweet repast,
      Of nobler joys above.

4   There, with united heart and voice,
      Before the eternal throne,
    Ten thousand thousand souls rejoice
      In ecstasies unknown.

5   And yet ten thousand thousand more
      Are welcome still to come:
    Ye longing souls, the grace adore;--
    Approach, there yet is room.

    What melodious sounds we hear,
    Bursting on the ravished ear!
    "At the feast there yet is room--
    Come and welcome, sinner, come.

2   "Thou shalt be a welcome guest,
    By the Lord divinely blest;--
    In the word of truth believe,--
    All thy sinful pleasures leave,
    And no more in darkness roam,--
    Come and welcome, sinner, come.

3   "God is thy unchanging Friend;
    He will love thee to the end,
    And at last thy soul convey
    To the realms of endless day,
    To a blessed spirit-home,--
    Come and welcome, sinner, come."

The Sinner entreated to awake.


1   Sinner, rouse thee from thy sleep;
    Wake, and o'er thy folly weep;
    Raise thy spirit, dark and dead;
    Jesus waits his light to shed.

2   Wake from sleep; arise from death;
    See the bright and living path;
    Watchful, tread that path; be wise;
    Leave thy folly; seek the skies.

3   Leave thy folly; cease from crime;
    From this hour redeem thy time;
    Life secure without delay;
    Brief is this thy mortal day.

4   O, then, rouse thee from thy sleep;
    Wake, and o'er thy folly weep;
    Jesus calls from death and night;
    Jesus waits to shed his light.

The Gospel gives Peace and Rest.


1   Peace, troubled soul, whose plaintive moan
      Hath taught these rocks the notes of woe;
    Cease thy complaints, suppress thy groan,
      And let thy tears forget to flow:
    Behold the precious balm is found,
    Which lulls thy pain, which heals thy wound.

2   Come, freely come; by sin oppressed,
      Unburden here the weighty load,
    Here find thy refuge and thy rest,
      And trust the mercy of thy God:
    Thy God's thy Father,--glorious word!
    Forever love and praise the Lord.

3   As spring the winter, day the night,
      Peace sorrow's gloom shall chase away,
    And smiling joy, a seraph bright,
      Shall tend thy steps and near thee stay;
    Whilst glory weaves th' immortal crown,
    And waits to claim thee for her own.

Invitation.


1   Pilgrim, burdened with thy sin,
      Come the way to Zion's gate,
    There, till mercy speaks within,
      Knock, and weep, and watch and wait--
    Knock--he knows the sinner's cry,
      Weep--he loves the mourner's tears,
    Watch--for saving grace is nigh,
      Wait--till heavenly grace appears.

2   Hark, it is thy Saviour's voice!
      "Welcome, pilgrim, to thy rest."
    Now within the gate rejoice,
      Safe, and owned, and bought and blest--
    Safe--from all the lures of vice,
      Owned--by joys the contrite know,
    Bought--by love and life the price,
      Blest--the mighty debt to owe!

3   Holy pilgrim! what for thee,
      In a world like this, remains?
    From thy guarded breast shall flee
      Fear, and shame, and doubt and pains--
    Fear--the hope of heaven shall fly,
      Shame--from glory's view retire,
    Doubt--in full belief shall die,
      Pain--in endless bliss expire.

1   Bright was the guiding star that led,
      With mild benignant ray,
    The Gentiles to the lowly shed
      Where the Redeemer lay.

2   But lo! a brighter, clearer light
      Now points to his abode
    It shines through sin and sorrow's night
      To guide us to our Lord.

3   O haste to follow where it leads;
      The gracious call obey,
    Be rugged wilds, or flowery meads,
      The Christian's destined way.

4   O gladly tread the narrow path
      While light and grace are given;
    We'll meekly follow Christ on earth,
      And reign with him in heaven.

Call to the Wandering.


1   Return, O wanderer, now return,
      And seek thy Father's face;
    Those new desires, which in thee burn,
      Were kindled by his grace.

2   Return, O wanderer, now return;
      He hears thy humble sigh;
    He sees thy softened spirit mourn,
      When no one else is nigh.

3   Return, O wanderer, now return;
      Thy Father bids thee live;
    Go to his feet, and grateful learn
      How freely he'll forgive.

4   Return, O wanderer, now return,
      And wipe the falling tear;
    Thy Father calls--no longer mourn;
      'T is love invites thee near.

"Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much."


1   Were not the sinful Mary's tears
      An offering worthy heaven,
    When, o'er the faults of former years,
      She wept, and was forgiven?

2   When, bringing every balmy sweet
      Her day of luxury stored,
    She o'er her Saviour's hallowed feet
      The precious ointment poured;

3   Were not those sweets so freely shed,
      That shame, those weeping eyes,
    And the sunk heart which inly bled,
      Heaven's noblest sacrifice?

4   Thou that hast slept in error's sleep,
      O wouldst thou wake to heaven,
    Like Mary kneel, like Mary weep;
      "Love much," and be forgiven!

      Turn thee, brother, homeward come.

2   Hast thou wasted all the powers
      God for noble uses gave?
    Squandered life's most golden hours?
      Turn thee, brother, God can save!

3   Is a mighty famine now
      In thy heart and in thy soul?
    Discontent upon thy brow?
      Turn thee, God will make thee whole!

4   Fall before him on the ground,
      Pour thy sorrow in his ear,
    Seek him, while he may be found,
      Call upon him, while he's near.

1   Blest are the souls that hear and know

    Peace shall attend the paths they go,
      And light their steps surround.

2   Their joy shall bear their spirits up,
      Through their Redeemer's name;
    His righteousness exalts their hope,
      Nor dares the world condemn.

3   The Lord, our glory and defence,
      Strength and salvation gives;
    Israel, thy King forever reigns,
      Thy God forever lives.

1   The King of heaven his table spreads,
      And dainties crown the board:
    Not Paradise, with all its joys,
      Could such delight afford.

2   Ye hungry poor, that long have strayed
      In sin's dark mazes, come;
    Come from your most obscure retreats
      And grace shall find you room.

3   Millions of souls, in glory now,
      Were fed and feasted here;
    And millions more, still on the way,
      Around the board appear.

4   Yet are his house and heart so large,
      That millions more may come;
    Nor could the whole assembled world
      O'erfill the spacious room.

    O, all ye ransomed souls, rejoice
      In your Redeemer's name.

2     Where sin and death have reigned,
      And all their power employed,
    There are his love and light maintained,
      And heavenly truth enjoyed.

3     The needy, starving poor
      Are filled with living bread;
    The opening of the prison door
      Proclaims the captive freed.

4   The thirsty, panting soul,
      That longs for springs of grace,
    Beholds celestial waters roll,
      And floods of righteousness.

5     My God, my Saviour too,
      I would thy love proclaim,
    Partake of what is brought to view,
      And sing thy glorious name.

      And all thy judgments just!
    Forever sure thy promise, Lord,

    Long hast roamed the barren waste,
    Weary pilgrim, hither haste!

    Seek for ease, but seek in vain;
    Ye, whose swollen and sleepless eyes
    Watch to see the morning rise;

4   Ye, by fiercer anguish torn,
    In remorse for guilt who mourn,
    Here repose your heavy care:
    Who the stings of guilt can bear?

5   Sinner, come! for here is found
    Balm that flows for every wound;
    Peace that ever shall endure,
    Rest eternal, sacred, sure.




TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY.

Christ's Kingdom among the Gentiles.


1   Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
    Does his successive journeys run;
    His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
    Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

2   For him shall endless prayer be made,
    And endless praises crown his head;
    His name, like sweet perfume, shall rise
    With every morning sacrifice.

3   People and realms of every tongue
    Dwell on his love with sweetest song;
    And infant voices shall proclaim
    Their early blessings on his name.

4   Blessings abound where'er he reigns;
    The joyful prisoner bursts his chains;
    The weary find eternal rest,
    And all the sons of want are blest.

5   Let every creature rise and bring
    Peculiar honors to our King;

    And earth repeat the loud Amen.

1   Jesus his empire shall extend;
      Beneath his gentle sway
    Kings of the earth shall humbly bend,
      And his commands obey.

2   From sea to sea, from shore to shore,
      All nations shall be blest;
    We hear the noise of war no more,--
      He gives his people rest.

3   As clouds descend in gentle showers,
      When spring renews her reign;
    And call to life the fragrant flowers
      O'er forest, hill and plain;--

4   So Jesus, by his heavenly grace,
      Descends on man below,
    And o'er the millions of our race
      His gentle blessings flow.

5   All that the reign of sin destroyed,
      The Saviour shall restore;
    And, from the treasures of the Lord,
      Shall give us blessings more.

    And righteousness and peace maintain.

2   The sceptre of his grace
      He shall forever wield;
    His foes, before his face,
      To strength divine shall yield:
    The conquest of his truth shall show
    What an almighty arm can do.

3   His alienated sons,
      By sin beguiled, betrayed,
    Shall then be born at once,
      And willing subjects made:
    Such numbers shall his courts adorn
    As dew-drops of the vernal morn.

4   His realm shall ever stand,
      By liberal things upheld:
    And from his bounteous hand
      All hearts with joy be filled.
    A universe with praise shall own
    The countless honors of his throne.

    Hail! in the time appointed
      His reign on earth begun!
    He comes to break oppression,
      To set the captive free,
    To take away transgression,
      And rule in equity.

2   He shall descend like showers
      Upon the fruitful earth,
    And love and joy, like flowers,
      Spring in his path to birth;
    Before him, on the mountains,
      Shall peace, the herald, go;
    And righteousness, in fountains,
      From hill to valley flow.

3   For him shall prayer unceasing
      And daily vows ascend,
    His kingdom still increasing,--
      A kingdom without end:
    The tide of time shall never
      His covenant remove:
    His name shall stand forever;--
      That name to us is love.

2   Zion, the desolate, again
      Shall see her lands with roses bloom;
    And Carmel's mount, and Sharon's plain,
      Shall yield their spices and perfume.

3   Celestial streams shall gently flow;
      The wilderness shall joyful be;
    Lilies on parchéd ground shall grow;
      And gladness spring on every tree;

4   The weak be strong, the fearful bold,
      The deaf shall hear, the dumb shall sing,
    The lame shall walk, the blind behold;
      And joy through all the earth shall ring.

5   Monarchs and slaves shall meet in love;
      Old pride shall die, and meekness reign,--
    When God descends from worlds above,
      To dwell with men on earth again.

    And Israel's sons, and Gentile lands,
      Shall in the banquet share.

2   See to the vilest of the vile
      A free acceptance given!
    See rebels, by adopting grace,
      Sit with the heirs of heaven!

3   The pained, the sick, the dying, now
      To ease and health restored,
    With eager appetites partake
      The plenties of the board.

4   But, O, what draughts of bliss unknown,
      What dainties shall be given,
    When, with the myriads round the throne,
      We join the feast of heaven!

5   There joys immeasurably high
      Shall overflow the soul,
    And springs of life, that never dry,
      In thousand channels roll.

    Zion is like one that dreams,
      Filled with wonder and delight.

3   Lo! thy sun goes down no more:
      God himself will be thy light:
    All that caused thee grief before
      Buried lies in endless night.

    These that crowd from far are thine;

Influence of the Gospel like Rain.


1   As showers on meadows newly mown,
    Jesus shall shed his blessings down;
    Crowned with whose life-infusing drops,
    Earth shall renew her blissful crops.

2   The dews and rains, in all their store,
    Drenching the pastures o'er and o'er,
    Are not so copious as that grace
    Which sanctifies and saves our race.

3   As, in soft silence, vernal showers
    Descend, and cheer the fainting flowers,
    So, in the secrecy of love,
    Falls the sweet influence from above.

4   That heavenly influence let me find
    In holy silence of the mind,
    While every grace maintains its bloom,
    Diffusing wide its rich perfume.

5   Nor let these blessings be confined
    To me, but poured on all mankind,
    Till earth's wild wastes in verdure rise,
    And a young Eden bless our eyes.

Efficacy of the Gospel.

      To heaven, from whence it fell,
        It turns not back again;
    But waters earth through every pore,
    And calls forth all her secret store.

2     Arrayed in beauteous green
        The hills and valleys shine,
      And man and beast are fed
        By providence divine:
    The harvest bows its golden ears,
    The copious seed of future years.

3     "So," saith the God of grace,
        "My Gospel shall descend,
      Almighty to effect
        The purpose I intend;
    Millions of souls shall feel its power,
    And bear it down to millions more."

      Of God's eternal day.

3     As music fills the grove
      When stormy clouds are past,
    Sweet anthems of redeeming love

          The work is thine;
          Saviour divine,
        Be thine the praise!

2   See crystal fountains play
      Amidst the burning sands;
    The river's winding way
      Shines through the thirsty lands;
        New grass is seen,
          Its carpet spreads
          And o'er the meads
        Of living green.

3   Where pointed brambles grew,
      Entwined with horrid thorn,
    Gay flowers, forever new,
      The painted fields adorn;
        The blushing rose,
          In union fair,
          And lily there,
        Their sweets disclose.

4   The tyrants of the plain
      Their savage chase give o'er;
    No more they rend the slain.
      And thirst for blood no more;
        But infant hands
          And lions yoke
          Fierce tigers stroke,
        In flowery bands.

5   O, when, Almighty Lord,
      Shall these glad scenes arise,
    To verify thy word,
      And bless our wondering eyes?
        That earth may raise,
          United songs
          With all its tongues,
        Of ardent praise.

The Gospel Triumphant.


1   Still in shades of midnight darkness
      Abject sits the Pagan world;
    There the banner of salvation
      Ne'er hath been by time unfurled;
          Nor their idols
    From their blood-stained altars hurled.

2   Yet the promise stands securely,
      And Messiah's reign shall spread;
    Not in vain his glorious conquest;
      Not in vain the Saviour bled.
          Chief immortal!
    God's own hand hath crowned thy head.

3   To this blessed dispensation
      Millions yet unborn shall fly;
    See the rising splendor beaming
      Till it gilds the western sky.
          Glorious Gospel!
    Still thy triumphs multiply.

The Church exulting in the Government of Jehovah.


1   Ye subjects of the Lord! proclaim
    The royal honors of his name:
      "Jehovah reigns!" be all our song.
    'T is He, thy God, O Zion, reigns!
    Prepare thy most harmonious strains
      Glad hallelujahs to prolong.

2   Tremble, ye pageants of a day,
    Formed, like your slaves, of brittle clay!
      Down to the dust your sceptres bend;
    To everlasting years He reigns,
    And undiminished state maintains,
      When kings, and suns, and time shall end.

3   So shall his favored Zion live:
    In vain confed'rate nations strive
      Her sacred turrets to destroy;
    Her Sov'reign sits enthroned above,
    And endless power and endless love
      Ensure her safety and her joy.

Restoration of Israel.


1   Daughter of Zion, from the dust
      Exalt thy fallen head;
    Again in thy Redeemer trust:
      He calls thee from the dead.

2   Awake, awake; put on thy strength,
      Thy beautiful array;
    The day of freedom dawns at length,
      The Lord's appointed day.

3   Rebuild thy walls, thy bounds enlarge,
      And send thy heralds forth;
    Say to the south, "Give up thy charge,
      And keep not back, O north!"

4   They come, they come;--thine exiled bands.
      Where'er they rest or roam,
    Have heard thy voice in distant lands,
      And hasten to their home.

The Same.


1   O, who shall see the glorious day,
      When, throned on Zion's brow,
    The Lord shall rend the veil away
      That hides the nations now!
    When earth no more beneath the fear
      Of his rebuke shall lie,
    When pain shall cease, and every tear
      Be wiped from every eye!

2   Then, Judah, thou no more shalt mourn
      Beneath the heathen's chain;
    Thy days of splendor shall return,
      And all be new again.
    The fount of life shall then be quaffed
      In peace by all who come;
    And every wind that blows, shall waft
      Some long-lost wand'rer home.

Prayer for the Jews.


1   Father of faithful Abraham! hear
      Our earnest suit for Abraham's seed:
    Justly they claim the fervent prayer
      From us, adopted in their stead;
    Who mercy, through their fall, obtain,
    And Christ, by their rejection, gain.

2   But hast thou finally forsook,
      Forever cast thine own away?
    Wilt thou not bid the murderers look
      On Him they pierced, and weep and pray?
    Yes! gracious Lord, thy word is past--
    "All Israel shall be saved at last."

3   Come, then, thou great Deliverer, come!
      The veil from Jacob's heart remove:
    Receive thine ancient people home,
      That, quickened by thy dying love,
    In their recovery we may find
    Life from the dead for all mankind.

The Missionary Angel.


1   Onward speed thy conquering flight;
      Angel, onward speed;
    Cast abroad thy radiant light,
      Bid the shades recede;
    Tread the idols in the dust,
      Heathen fanes destroy,
    Spread the gospel's holy trust,
      Spread the gospel's joy.

2   Onward speed thy conquering flight;
      Angel, onward haste;
    Quickly on each mountain's height
      Be thy standard placed;
    Let thy blissful tidings float
      Far o'er vale and hill,
    Till the sweetly-echoing note
      Every bosom thrill.

3   Onward speed thy conquering flight;
      Angel, onward fly:
    Long has been the reign of night;
      Bring the morning nigh:
    'Tis to thee the heathen lift
      Their imploring wail;
    Bear them Heaven's holy gift,
      Ere their courage fail.

4   Onward speed thy conquering flight
      Angel, onward speed;
    Morning bursts upon our sight--
      'Tis the time decreed:
    Jesus now his kingdom takes,
      Thrones and empires fall,
    And the joyous song awakes,
      "God is all in all."

1   O Zion, tune thy voice,
      And raise thy hands on high;
    Tell all the earth thy joys,
      And boast salvation nigh.
        Cheerful in God,
          Arise and shine,
          While rays divine
        Stream all abroad.

2   He gilds thy mourning face
      With beams that cannot fade;
    His all-resplendent grace
      He pours around thy head.
        The nations round
          Thy form shall view,
          With lustre new
        Divinely crowned.

3   In honor to his name,
      Reflect that sacred light,
    And loud that grace proclaim,
      Which makes thy darkness bright;
        Pursue his praise,
          Till sovereign love
          In worlds above
        The glory raise.

      Holy light and comfort bring.

2   Let the heralds of salvation
      Round the world with joy proclaim,
    "Death and hell are spoiled and vanquished
      Through the great Immanuel's name."

3   Take thy power, almighty Saviour;
      Claim the nations for thine own;
    Reign, thou Lord of life and glory,
      Till each heart becomes thy throne.

4   Then the earth, o'erspread with glory,
      Decked with heavenly splendor bright
    Shall be made Jehovah's dwelling--
      As at first, the Lord's delight.

Millennium Hymn.


1     Isles of the south, awake!
        The song of triumph sing;
      Let mount, and hill, and vale,
        With hallelujahs ring:
    Shout, for the idol's overthrown,
    And Israel's God is God alone.

2     Wild wastes of Afric, shout!
        Your shackled sons are free;
      No mother wails her child
        'Neath the banana-tree:
    No slave-ship dashes on thy shore;
    The clank of chains is heard no more.

3     Shout, vales of India, shout!
        No funeral fires blaze high;
      No idol song rings loud,
        As rolls the death-car by:
    The banner of the cross now waves
    Where Christian heralds made their graves.

4     Shout, hills of Palestine!
        Have you forgot the groan,
      The spear, the thorn, the cross,
        The wine-press trod alone,
    The dying prayer that rose from thee,
    Thou garden of Gethsemane?

5     Hail, glad, millennial day!
        O, shout, ye heavens above!
      To-day ye nations sing
        The song, redeeming love:
    Redeeming love the song shall be:
    Hail, blessed year of jubilee!

Kingdom of Christ.


1   To Christ, the Son, the Father spake:
    Lo, ask of me, and I will make
      The heathen to thy sceptre bend;
    The utmost parts of all the earth
    Are thine inheritance by birth,
      And wide thine empire shall extend.

2   Now Jesus waves his sceptre high,
    Unfurls his banners in the sky,
      While loud the gospel trumpets sound:
    His enemies with sore dismay,
    Retire in haste and yield the day,
      While trophies to the Lord abound.

3   Before him kings and tyrants fall,
    Detest their crowns, and on him call,
      And he a pardon free doth give:
    The world in sin was dead before;
    To life the world he will restore,
      And in him all the world shall live.

4   O Lord, thy government shall be
    Extended wide from sea to sea,
      And long thy sceptre thou shalt hold;
    As long as sun or moon shall shine,
    Thou King of earth shalt reign divine,
      The mysteries of thy grace unfold.




REPENTANCE AND REFORMATION.

Prayer for Mercy in Spiritual Need.


1   Lord, have mercy when we pray
    Strength to seek a better way;
    When our wakening thoughts begin
    First to loathe their cherished sin;
    When our weary spirits fail,
    And our aching brows are pale;
    When our tears bedew thy word;
    Then, O then, have mercy, Lord.

2   Lord, have mercy when we lie
    On the restless bed and sigh,--
    Sigh for death, yet fear it still;
    From the thought of former ill;
    When the dim, advancing gloom
    Tells us that our hour is come;
    When is loosed the silver cord;
    Then, O then, have mercy, Lord.

3   Lord, have mercy, when we know
    First how vain this world below:
    When its darker thoughts oppress,
    Doubts perplex, and fears distress;
    When the earliest gleam is given
    Of the bright but distant heaven;
    Then thy fostering grace afford;
    Then, O then, have mercy, Lord.

The Prodigal's Return.


1   The long-lost son, with streaming eyes,
      From folly just awake,
    Reviews his wanderings with surprise;
      His heart begins to break.

2   "I starve," he cries, "nor can I bear
      The famine in this land,
    While servants of my Father share
      The bounty of his hand.

3   "With deep repentance I'll return
      And seek my Father's face;
    Unworthy to be called a son,
      I'll ask a servant's place."

4   Far off the Father saw him move,
      In pensive silence mourn,
    And quickly ran with arms of love,
      To welcome his return.

5   O, let thy boundless mercy shine
      On my benighted soul,
    Correct my passions, mend my heart,
      And all my fears control.

Imploring Forgiveness and Renewal of Heart.


1   Forgive us for thy mercy's sake;
      Our multitude of sins forgive;
    And for thy own possession take,
      And bid us to thy glory live;
    Live in thy sight and gladly prove
    Our faith by our obedient love.

2   The covenant of forgiveness seal,
      And all thy mighty wonders show;
    Our hidden enemies expel,
      And conquering them to conquer go,
    Till all of pride and wrath be slain,
    And not one evil thought remain.

3   O, put it in our inward parts
      The living law of perfect love:
    Write the new precept on our hearts;
      We shall not then from thee remove,
    Who in thy glorious image shine,
    Thy people, and forever thine.

Inconstancy Lamented.


1   The wandering star and fleeting wind
    Are emblems of the fickle mind;
    The morning cloud and early dew
    Bring our inconstancy to view.

2   But cloud and wind and dew and star,
    Only a faint resemblance bear;
    Nor can there aught in nature be
    So changeable and frail as we.

3   Our outward walk and inward frame
    Are scarcely through an hour the same:
    We vow, and straight our vows forget,
    And then those very vows repeat.

4   With contrite hearts, Lord, we confess
    Our folly and unsteadfastness:
    When shall these hearts more stable be,
    Fixed by thy grace alone on thee?

God's Mercy to the Penitent.


1     Sweet is the friendly voice
      Which speaks of life and peace;
    Which bids the penitent rejoice,
      And sin and sorrow cease.

2     No balm on earth like this
      Can cheer the contrite heart;
    No flattering dreams of earthly bliss
      Such pure delight impart.

3     Still merciful and kind,
      Thy mercy, Lord, reveal:
    The broken heart thy love can bind,
      The wounded spirit heal.

4     Thy presence shall restore
      Peace to my anxious breast:
    Lord, let my steps be drawn no more
      From paths which thou hast blessed.

Returning to God.


1   Lord, we have wandered from thy way,
    Like foolish sheep have gone astray,
    Our pleasant pastures we have left,
    And of their guard our souls bereft.

2   Exposed to want, exposed to harm,
    Far from our gentle Shepherd's arm;
    Nor will these fatal wanderings cease,
    Till thou reveal the paths of peace.

3   O seek thy thoughtless servants, Lord,
    Nor let us quite forget thy word;
    Our erring feet do thou restore,
    And keep us that we stray no more.

Sense of Sin.


1   Jesus demands this heart of mine,
      Demands my love, my joy, my care,
    But ah, how dead to things divine,
      How cold my best affections are!

2   'Tis sin, alas! with dreadful power,
      Divides my Saviour from my sight;
    O, for one happy, shining hour
      Of sacred freedom, sweet delight!

3   Come, gracious Lord; thy love can raise
      My captive powers from sin and death,
    And fill my heart and life with praise,
      And tune my last, expiring breath.

The True Penitent.


1   O sinner! bring not tears alone,
      Or outward form of prayer:
    But let it in thy heart be known
      That penitence is there.

2   To beat the breast, the clothes to rend,
      God asketh not of thee:
    Thy secret soul he bids thee bend
      In true humility.

3   O righteous Judge! if thou wilt deign
      To grant us what we need;
    We pray for time to turn again,
      And grace to turn indeed.

Translated by J. Wesley.

Devout Penitence.


1   My soul before thee prostrate lies;
    To thee, her source, my spirit flies;
    My wants I mourn, my chains I see;
    O let thy presence set me free.

2   In life's short day, let me yet more
    Of thy enlivening power implore;
    My mind must deeper sink in thee,
    My foot stand firm from wandering free.

3   Take full possession of my heart;
    The lowly mind of Christ impart;
    I still will wait, O Lord, on thee,
    Till, in thy light, the light I see.

4   One only care my soul should know,
    Father, all thy commands to do;
    Oh! deep engrave it on my breast,
    That I in thee alone am blest.

Vain Repentance.


1   Times without number have I prayed,
      "This only once forgive;"
    Relapsing when thy hand was stayed,
      And suffered me to live.

2   Yet now the kingdom of thy peace,
      Lord, to my heart restore;
    Forgive my vain repentances,
      And bid me sin no more.

"There is Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that Repenteth."


1   There was joy in heaven!
    There was joy in heaven!
    When this goodly world to frame,
    The Lord of light and mercy came:
    Shouts of joy were heard on high,
    And the stars sang from the sky,
      "Glory to God in heaven!"

2   There was joy in heaven!
    There was joy in heaven!
    When of love the midnight beam
    Dawned on the towers of Bethlehem;
    And along the echoing hill
    Angels sang--"On earth good will,
      And glory in the heaven!"

3   There is joy in heaven!
    There is joy in heaven!
    When the sheep that went astray
    Turns again to virtue's way;
    When the soul by grace subdued
    Sobs its prayer of gratitude,
      Then is there joy in heaven!

Freedom from Error, Guilt and Folly.


1   Blest Instructor! from thy ways
    Who can tell how oft he strays?
    Save from error's growth our mind,
    Leave not, Lord, one root behind.

2   Purge us from the guilt that lies
    Wrapt within our heart's disguise;
    Let us thence, by thee renewed,
    Each presumptuous sin exclude.

3   Let our tongues, from error free,
    Speak the words approved by thee:
    To thine all-observing eyes,
    Let our thoughts accepted rise.

4   While we thus thy name adore,
    And thy healing grace implore,
    Blest Instructor! bow thine ear:
    God our strength! propitious hear.

1   O God, thy grace impart!
    Revive my fainting heart;
      My zeal inspire;
    Reveal thyself to me,
    And may my love to thee
    Pure, warm, and changeless be,--
      A living fire.

2   While life's dark maze I tread,
    And griefs around me spread,
      Be thou my guide;
    Bid darkness turn to day,
    Wipe sorrow's tears away,
    Nor let me ever stray
      From thee aside.

3   When ends life's transient dream,
    When death's cold sullen stream
      Shall o'er me roll,
    O Father, then in love,
    Fear and distress remove,
    And bear me safe above,--
      A ransomed soul.

Pardon.


1   Soft are the fruitful showers that bring
    The welcome promise of the spring,
      And soft the vernal gale:
    Sweet the wild warblings of the grove,
    The voice of nature and of love,
      That gladden every vale.

2   But softer in the mourner's ear
    Sounds the mild voice of mercy near,
      That whispers sins forgiven;
    And sweeter far the music swells,
    When to the raptured soul she tells
      Of peace and promised heaven.

3   Fair are the flowers that deck the ground;
    And groves and gardens blooming round,
      Unnumbered charms unfold:
    Bright is the sun's meridian ray,
    And bright the beams of setting day,
      That robe the clouds in gold.

4   But far more fair the pious breast,
    In richer robes of goodness dressed,
      Where heaven's own graces shine;
    And brighter far the prospects rise,
    That burst on faith's delighted eyes,
      From glories all divine.

Peace after a Storm.


1   When darkness long has veiled my mind,
      And smiling day once more appears,
    Then, my Creator! then I find
      The folly of my doubts and fears.

2   Straight I upbraid my wandering heart,
      And blush that I should ever be
    Thus prone to act so base a part,
      Or harbor one hard thought of thee.

3   O! let me then at length be taught,
      What I am still so slow to learn,--
    That God is love, and changes not,
      Nor knows the shadow of a turn.

4   Sweet truth, and easy to repeat!
      But when my faith is sharply tried,
    I find myself a learner yet,
      Unskilful, weak, and apt to slide.

5   But, O my God! one look from thee
      Subdues the disobedient will,
    Drives doubt and discontent away,
      And thy rebellious child is still.

2   Our wishes, our desires, control;
    Mould every purpose of the soul;
    O'er all may we victorious be
    That stands between ourselves and thee.

3   Thrice blest will all our blessings be,
    When we can look through them to thee,
    When each glad heart its tribute pays
    Of love, and gratitude, and praise.

4   And while we to thy glory live,
    May we to thee all glory give,
    Until the final summons come,
    That calls thy willing servants home.




CHRISTIAN CHARACTER AND LIFE.




339.              L. M.                     Watts.

"Ye shall know them by their Fruits."


1   So let our lips and lives express
    The holy gospel we profess:
    So let our works and virtues shine,
    To prove the doctrine all divine.

2   Thus shall we best proclaim abroad
    The honors of our Saviour, God,
    When the salvation reigns within.
    And grace subdues the power of sin.

3   Our flesh and sense must be denied,
    Passion and envy, lust and pride,
    While justice, temperance, truth and love,
    Our inward piety approve.

4   Religion bears our spirits up,
    While we expect that blessed hope,
    The bright appearance of the Lord,
    And faith stands leaning on his word.

The Christian's Life and his Hope.


1   A soldier's course, from battles won
      To new-commencing strife;
    A pilgrim's, restless as the sun--
      Behold the Christian's life!

2   O! let us seek our heavenly home,
      Revealed in sacred lore;
    The land whence pilgrims never roam,
      Where soldiers war no more;

3   Where grief shall never wound, nor death,
      Beneath the Saviour's reign;
    Nor sin, with pestilential breath,
      His holy realm profane;

4   The land where, suns and moons unknown,
      And night's alternate sway,
    Jehovah's ever-burning throne
      Upholds unbroken day;

5   Where they who meet shall never part;
      Where grace achieves its plan;
    And God, uniting every heart,
      Dwells face to face with man.




341.              L. M.                 E. Taylor.

"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God."


1   "Thus shalt thou love the Almighty Lord,
      With all thy heart, and soul, and mind:"
    So speaks to man that sacred word,
      For counsel and reproof designed.

2   "With all thy heart;" no idol thing,
      Though close around the heart it twine,
    Its interposing shade must fling,
      To darken that pure love of thine.

3   "With all thy mind;" each varied power,
      Creative fancy, musings high,
    And thoughts that glance behind, before,
      These must religion sanctify.

4   "With soul and strength;" thy days of ease,
      While vigor nerves each youthful limb,
    And hope and joy, and health and peace,
      All must be freely brought to him.




342.              C. M.                 Doddridge.

Walking with God.


1   Thrice happy souls, who, born from heaven,
      While yet they sojourn here,
    Do all their days with God begin,
      And spend them in his fear.

2   'Midst hourly cares, may love present
      Its incense to thy throne;
    And while the world our hands employs,
      Our hearts be thine alone.

3   As sanctified to noblest ends,
      Be each refreshment sought;
    And by each various providence
      Some wise instruction brought.

4   When to laborious duties called,
      Or by temptations tried,
    We'll seek the shelter of thy wings,
      And in thy strength confide.

5   In solid, pure delights like these,
      Let all our days be past;
    Nor shall we then impatient wish,
      Nor shall we fear, the last.

Watchfulness and Prayer inculcated.


1     My soul, be on thy guard;
      Ten thousand foes arise;
    The hosts of sin are pressing hard
      To draw thee from the skies.

2     O, watch, and fight, and pray;
      The battle ne'er give o'er;
    Renew it boldly every day,
      And help divine implore.

3     Ne'er think the victory won,
      Nor lay thine armor down:
    Thy arduous work will not be done
      Till thou obtain thy crown.

4     Fight on, my soul, till death
      Shall bring thee to thy God;
    He'll take thee, at thy parting breath,
      To his divine abode.




344.              L. M.                     Watts.

The Beatitudes.


1   Blest are the humble souls that see
    Their emptiness and poverty;
    Treasures of grace to them are given,
    And crowns of joy laid up in heaven.

2   Blest are the souls that thirst for grace,
    Hunger and long for righteousness;
    They shall be well supplied and fed
    With living streams and living bread.

3   Blest are the pure, whose hearts are clean
    From the defiling power of sin;
    With endless pleasure they shall see
    A God of spotless purity.

4   Blest are the men of peaceful life,
    Who quench the coals of growing strife;
    They shall be called the heirs of bliss,
    The sons of God, the God of peace.

5   Blest are the sufferers who partake
    Of pain and shame for Jesus' sake;
    Their souls shall triumph in the Lord;
    Glory and joy are their reward.




345.              L. M.             Rippon's Coll.

Patience.


1   Patience, O, 't is a grace divine,
      Sent from the God of peace and love,
    That leans upon our Father's arm,
      As through the wilds of life we rove.

2   By patience, we serenely bear
      The troubles of our mortal state,
    And wait, contented, our discharge,
      Nor think our glory comes too late.

3   O, for this grace to aid us on,
      And arm with fortitude the breast,
    Till, life's tumultuous voyage o'er,
      We reach the shores of endless rest.

4   Faith into vision shall resign,
      Hope shall in full fruition die,
    And patience in possession end,
      In the bright worlds of bliss on high.

"Who shall abide in thy tabernacle?"  Ps. 15.


1   Who shall towards thy chosen seat
    Turn, O Lord, his favored feet?
    Who shall at thine altar bend?
    Who shall Zion's hill ascend?
    Who, great God, a welcome guest,
    On thy holy mountain rest?

2   He whose heart thy love has warmed,
    He whose will, to thine conformed,
    Bids his life unsullied run;
    He whose word and thought are one;
    Who, from sin's contagion free,
    Lifts his willing soul to thee.

3   He who thus, with heart unstained,
    Treads the path by thee ordained,
    He shall towards thy chosen seat
    Turn, O Lord, his favored feet;
    He thy ceaseless care shall prove,
    He shall share thy constant love.

The Same.


1   Lord, who's the happy man, that may
      To thy blest courts repair,
    Not, stranger-like, to visit them,
      But to inhabit there?

2   'Tis he whose every thought and deed
      By rules of virtue moves;
    Whose generous tongue disdains to speak
      The thing his heart disproves;

3   Who never did a slander forge,
      His neighbor's fame to wound;
    Nor hearken to a false report,
      By malice whispered round;

4   Who to his plighted vows and trust
      Has ever firmly stood;
    And though he promise to his loss,
      He makes his promise good.

5   The man who by this steady course
      Has happiness ensured,
    When earth's foundations shake, shall stand
      By Providence secured.

"Blessed are the Meek."


1   "Blest are the meek," he said,
      Whose doctrine is divine;
    The humble-minded earth possess,
      And bright in heaven will shine.

2   While here on earth they stay,
      Calm peace with them shall dwell,
    And cheerful hope and heavenly joy
      Beyond what tongue can tell.

3   The God of peace is theirs;
      They own his gracious sway;
    And yielding all their wills to him,
      His sovereign laws obey.

4   O gracious Father, grant,
      That we this influence feel,
    That all we hope, or wish, may be
      Subjected to thy will.




349.              L. M.                     Scott.

The Blessing of Meekness.


1   Happy the meek, whose gentle breast,
      Clear as the summer's evening ray,
    Calm as the regions of the blest,
      Enjoys on earth celestial day.

2   His heart no broken friendships sting,
      No storms his peaceful tent invade;
    He rests beneath th' Almighty wing,
      Hostile to none, of none afraid.

3   Spirit of grace, all meek and mild,
      Inspire our breasts, our souls possess;
    Repel each passion rude and wild,
      And bless us as we aim to bless.

The Pure Heart.


1   Whatever dims thy sense of truth,
      Or stains thy purity,
    Though light as breath of summer air
      Count it as sin to thee.

2   Preserve the tablet of thy thoughts
      From every blemish free,
    While the Redeemer's lowly faith
      Its temple makes with thee.

3   And pray of God, that grace be given
      To tread time's narrow way:--
    How dark soever it may be,
      It leads to cloudless day.




351.              S. M.                     Keble.

"Blessed are the Pure in Heart."


1     Blest are the pure in heart
      For they shall see our God;
    The secret of the Lord is theirs,
      Their soul is Christ's abode.

2     Still to the lowly soul
      He doth himself impart,
    And for his temple and his throne
      Chooseth the pure in heart.




352.              C. M.                     Watts.

Prudence.


1   O, 't is a lovely thing to see
      A man of prudent heart,
    Whose thoughts and lips and life agree
      To act a useful part.

2   When envy, strife, and wars begin,
      In fierce, contentious souls,
    Mark how the sons of peace come in,
      And quench the kindling coals.

3   Their minds are humble, mild, and meek,
      Nor let their anger rise;
    Nor passion moves their lips to speak,
      Nor pride exalts their eyes.

4   Their lives are prudence mixed with love;
      Good works employ their day;
    They join the serpent with the dove,
      But cast the sting away.




353.            L. M. 6l.              Montgomery.

Humility.


1   The bird that soars on highest wing
      Builds on the ground her lowly nest;
    And she that doth most sweetly sing
      Sings in the shade when all things rest:--
    In lark and nightingale we see
    What honor hath humility.

2   When Mary chose the better part,
      She meekly sat at Jesus' feet;
    And Lydia's gently opened heart
      Was made for God's own temple meet:--
    Fairest and best adorned is she
    Whose clothing is humility.

3   The saint that wears heaven's brightest crown
      In deepest adoration bends;
    The weight of glory bows him down
      Then most when most his soul ascends:--
    Nearest the throne itself must be
    The footstool of humility.




354.              C. M.                     Watts.

Humility and Submission.


1   Is there ambition in my heart?
      Search, gracious God, and see;
    Or do I act a haughty part?
      Lord, I appeal to thee.

2   I charge my thoughts, be humble still,
      And all my carriage mild;
    Content, my Father, with thy will
      And quiet as a child.

3   The patient soul, the lowly mind,
      Shall have a large reward:
    Let saints in sorrow lie resigned,
      And trust a faithful Lord.




355.              L. M.                     Watts.

Love to God and our Neighbor.


1   Thus saith the first, the great command,
      "Let all thy inward powers unite
    To love thy Maker and thy God
      With utmost vigor and delight.

2   "Then shall thy neighbor next in place
      Share thine affections and esteem;
    And let thy kindness to thyself
      Measure and rule thy love to him."

3   This is the sense that Moses spoke;
      This did the prophets preach and prove,
    For want of this the law is broke,
      And the whole law's fulfilled by love.

4   But, O, how base our passions are!
      How cold our charity and zeal!
    Lord, fill our souls with heavenly fire,
      Or we shall ne'er perform thy will.

Active Piety.


1     Servants of Christ, arise,
      And gird you for the toil;
    The dew of promise from the skies
      Already cheers the soil.

2     Go where the sick recline,
      Where mourning hearts deplore;
    And where the sons of sorrow pine,
      Dispense your hallowed lore.

3     Urge, with a tender zeal,
      The erring child along,
    Where peaceful congregations kneel,
      And pious teachers throng.

4     Be faith, which looks above,
      With prayer, your constant guest,
    And wrap the Saviour's changeless love
      A mantle round your breast.

5     So shall you share the wealth,
      That earth may ne'er despoil,
    And the blest gospel's saving health
      Repay your arduous toil.

Example of the Saviour.


1   And is the gospel peace and love?
      So let our conversation be;
    The serpent blended with the dove,
      Wisdom and meek simplicity.

2   Whene'er the angry passions rise,
      And tempt our thoughts or tongues to strife,
    On Jesus let us fix our eyes,
      Bright pattern of the Christian life!

3   O, how benevolent and kind!
      How mild! how ready to forgive!
    Be this the temper of our mind,
      And his the rules by which we live.

4   Dispensing good where'er he came,
      The labors of his life were love;
    If, then, we love our Saviour's name
      Thus let us our relation prove.




358.              S. M.                 Doddridge.

"Again, I say--Watch!"


1     Ye servants of the Lord,
      Each in his office wait,
    Observant of his heavenly word,
      And watchful at his gate.

2     Let all your lamps be bright,
      And trim the golden flame;
    Gird up your loins, as in his sight,
      For awful is his name.

3     Watch,--'tis your Lord's command;
      And while we speak, he's near;
    Mark the first signal of his hand,
      And ready all appear.

4     O, happy servant he,
      In such a posture found!
    He shall his Lord with rapture see
      And be with honor crowned.

The Use of Present Opportunities.


1     Children of light, awake,
      At Jesus' call arise,
    Forth with your leader to partake
      His toils, his victories.

2     Ye must not idly stand,
      His sacred voice who hear;
    Arm for the strife the feeble hand,
      The holy standard rear.

3     Nought doth the world afford,
      But toil must be the price;
    Wilt thou not, servant of the Lord,
      Then toil for paradise?

4     Awake, ye sons of light,
      Strive till the prize be won;
    Far spent already is the night;
      The day comes brightening on.

The Christian's Contest, Rest, and Hope.


1   Through sorrow's night and danger's way
      Amid the deepening gloom,
    The soldiers of an injured King
      Are marching to the tomb.

2   Their service done, securely laid
      In this their last retreat,
    Unheeded o'er their silent dust
      The storms of life shall beat.

3   Yet not thus lifeless in the grave
      The vital spark shall lie;
    O'er nature's ruins it shall rise,
      To reach its kindred sky.

4   Then heaven's soft dew o'er every eye
      Shall shed its mildest rays;
    And the long silent dust shall wake
      In strains of endless praise.

The whole Armor.


1   O, speed thee, Christian, on thy way,
      And to thy armor cling;
    With girded loins the call obey
      That grace and mercy bring.

2   There is a battle to be fought,
      An upward race to run,
    A crown of glory to be sought,
      A victory to be won.

3   O, faint not, Christian, for thy sighs
      Are heard before His throne;
    The race must come before the prize,
      The cross before the crown.

The Christian Warrior.


1   The Christian warrior, see him stand
      In the whole armor of his God;
    The spirit's sword is in his hand;
      His feet are with the gospel shod.

2   In panoply of truth complete,
      Salvation's helmet on his head,
    With righteousness, a breastplate meet,
      And faith's broad shield before him spread.

3   With this omnipotence he moves;
      From this the alien armies flee;
    Till more than conqueror he proves,
      Through Christ, who gives him victory.

4   Thus strong in his Redeemer's strength,
      Sin, death and hell he tramples down,--
    Fights the good fight; and takes at length,
      Through mercy, an immortal crown.

Religion.


1   Religion! in its blessed ray
      All thought of hopeless sorrow flies,
    Despair and anguish melt away
      Where'er its healing beams arise.
    How dark our sinful world would be--
      A flowerless desert, dry and drear!
    Did not this light, O God, from thee
      Its gloom dispel, its aspect cheer.

2   Oh! by it many a heart is soothed,
      Which else would be with sorrow crushed,
    And many a dying pillow smoothed,
      And sob of parting anguish hushed.
    Across the troubled sky of time
      It doth the bow of promise bend,
    A symbol of that cloudless clime
      That waits the soul when time shall end.

3   Religion! may its holy light
      Our footsteps guide to paths of peace!
    Our solace in deep sorrow's night,
      Our stay as mortal powers decrease.
    With this our guide, we care not when
      Death's signal to depart is given;
    Its word shall bring our spirits then
      The calm and holy peace of heaven.

    Dwell in my own eternity.

2   "But I descend to worlds below;
    On earth I have a mansion too;
    The humble spirit, and contrite,
    Is an abode of my delight.

3   "The humble soul my words revive;
    I bid the mourning sinner live;
    Heal all the broken hearts I find,
    And ease the sorrows of the mind.

4   "The soul that seeks me shall obtain
    Immortal wealth and heavenly gain;

    Life, and the favor of the Lord."

A Call to Prayer.


1   They who seek the throne of grace
    Find that throne in every place;
    If we love a life of prayer,
    God is present everywhere.

2   In our sickness, in our health;
    In our want or in our wealth,
    If we look to God in prayer,
    God is present everywhere.

3   When our earthly comforts fail,
    When the woes of life prevail,
    'Tis the time for earnest prayer,
    God is present everywhere.

4   Then, my soul, in every strait,
    To thy Father, come and wait;
    He will answer every prayer,
    God is present everywhere.

Secret Prayer.


1   Sweet is the prayer whose holy stream
      In earnest pleading flows!
    Devotion dwells upon the theme,
      And warm and warmer glows.

2   Faith grasps the blessing she desires;
      Hope points the upward gaze;
    And Love, celestial Love, inspires
      The eloquence of praise.

3   But sweeter far the still, small voice,
      Unheard by human ear,
    When God has made the heart rejoice,
      And dried the bitter tear.

4   No accents flow, no words ascend;
      All utterance faileth there;
    But Christian spirits comprehend,
      And God accepts the prayer.

The Warfare of the Soul.


1   Awake, my soul! lift up thine eyes!
    See where thy foes against thee rise,
    In long array a numerous host;
    Awake, my soul! or thou art lost.

2   See where rebellious passions rage,
    And fierce desires and lusts engage;
    The meanest foe of all the train
    Has thousands and ten thousands slain.

3   Come then, my soul! now learn to wield
    The weight of thine immortal shield;
    Put on the armor from above,
    Of heavenly truth and heavenly love.

4   The terror and the charm repel,
    And powers of earth and powers of hell,
    The man of Calvary triumphed here;--
    Why should his faithful followers fear?

      Hold thee in full survey;
    Forget the steps already trod,
      And onward urge thy way.

3   'T is God's all-animating voice
      That calls thee from on high;
    'T is his own hand presents the prize
      To thine aspiring eye;--

4   That prize with peerless glories bright,
      Which shall new lustre boast,
    When victors' wreaths and monarchs' gems
      Shall blend in common dust.




369.              C. M.                     Watts.

Christian Courage and Self-denial.


1   Am I a soldier of the cross,
      A follower of the Lamb?
    And shall I fear to own his cause,
      Or blush to speak his name?

2   Must I be carried to the skies
      On flowery beds of ease,
    While others fought to win the prize,
      And sailed through bloody seas?

3   Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
      Increase my courage, Lord!
    I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
      Supported by thy word.

4   Thy saints, in all this glorious war,
      Shall conquer, though they're slain:
    They see the triumph from afar,
      And soon with Christ shall reign.

5   When that illustrious day shall rise,
      And all thy armies shine
    In robes of victory through the skies,
      The glory shall be thine.




370.              L. M.                     Watts.

The Christian Race.


1   Awake, our souls, away, our fears;
      Let every trembling thought be gone;
    Awake and run the heavenly race,
      And put a cheerful courage on.

2   True 'tis a strait and thorny road,
      And mortal spirits tire and faint;
    But they forget the mighty God,
      That feeds the strength of every saint.

3   From thee, the overflowing spring,
      Our souls shall drink a fresh supply,
    While such as trust their native strength,
      Shall melt away, and droop, and die.

4   Swift as an eagle cuts the air,
      We'll mount aloft to thine abode;
    On wings of love our souls shall fly,
      Nor tire amidst the heavenly road.




371.              C. M.                Montgomery.

What is Prayer?


1   Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
      Uttered or unexpressed,
    The motion of a hidden fire,
      That trembles in the breast.

2   Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
      The falling of a tear,
    The upward glancing of an eye,
      When none but God is near.

3   Prayer is the simplest form of speech
      That infant lips can try,
    Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
      The Majesty on high.

4   Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
      The Christian's native air,
    The watchword at the gates of death;
      He enters heaven with prayer.

5   Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice,
      Returning from his ways;
    While angels in their songs rejoice,
      And cry "Behold, he prays!"




372.             7s. M.               Mrs. Hemans.

"I will that men pray everywhere."


1   Child, amidst the flowers at play,
    While the red light fades away;
    Mother, with thine earnest eye
    Ever following silently;
    Father, by the breeze of eve
    Called thy daily work to leave;
    Pray! ere yet the dark hours be,
    Lift the heart and bend the knee!

2   Traveller, in the stranger's land,
    Far from thine own household band;
    Mourner, haunted by the tone
    Of a voice from this world gone;
    Captive, in whose narrow cell
    Sunshine hath not leave to dwell;
    Sailor, on the darkening sea--
    Lift the heart and bend the knee!




373.          7s. & 6s. M.      Edin. Lit. Review.

Pray without ceasing.


1   Go when the morning shineth,
      Go when the noon is bright,
    Go when the eve declineth,
      Go in the hush of night;
    Go with pure mind and feeling,
      Cast earthly thought away,
    And, in thy closet kneeling,
      Do thou in secret pray.

2   Remember all who love thee,
      All who are loved by thee;
    Pray, too, for those who hate thee,
      If any such there be;
    Then for thyself, in meekness,
      A blessing humbly claim,
    And blend with each petition
      Thy great Redeemer's name.

3   Or, if 'tis e'er denied thee
      In solitude to pray,
    Should holy thoughts come o'er thee
      When friends are round thy way,
    E'en then the silent breathing,
      Thy spirit raised above,
    Will reach his throne of glory,
      Where dwells eternal love.

4   O, not a joy or blessing
      With this can we compare,--
    The grace our Father gave us
      To pour our souls in prayer:
    Whene'er thou pin'st in sadness,
      Before his footstool fall;
    Remember, in thy gladness,
      His love who gave thee all.




374.              L. M.                     Watts.

"We walk by faith, not by sight."


1   'T is by the faith of joys to come
      We walk through deserts dark as night;
    Till we arrive at heaven, our home,
      Faith is our guide, and faith our light.

2   The want of sight she well supplies;
      She makes the pearly gates appear;
    Far into distant worlds she flies,
      And brings eternal glories near.

3   Cheerful we tread the desert through,
      While faith inspires a heavenly ray;
    Though lions roar and tempests blow,
      And rocks and dangers fill the way.

4   So Abraham, by divine command,
      Left his own house to walk with God;
    His faith beheld the promised land,
      And fired his zeal along the road.




375.              C. M.            Salisbury Coll.

The Power of Faith.


1   Faith adds new charms to earthly bliss,
      And saves us from its snares;
    Its aid in every duty brings,
      And softens all our cares.

2   The wounded conscience knows its power
      The healing balm to give;
    That balm the saddest heart can cheer,
      And make the dying live.

3   Wide it unveils celestial worlds,
      Where deathless pleasures reign,
    And bids us seek our portion there,
      Nor bids us seek in vain.

4   On that bright prospect may we rest,
      Till this frail body dies;
    And then, on faith's triumphant wings,
      To endless glory rise.




376.            S. H. M.       Christian Watchman.

Excellence of Faith.


1       Faith is the Christian's prop
        Whereon his sorrows lean;
      It is the substance of his hope,
        His proof of things unseen;
    It is the anchor of his soul
    When tempests rage and billows roll.

2       Faith is the polar star
        That guides the Christian's way,
      Directs his wanderings from afar
        To realms of endless day;
    It points the course where'er he roam,
    And safely leads the pilgrim home.

3       Faith is the rainbow's form,
        Hung on the brow of heaven,
      The glory of the passing storm,
        The pledge of mercy given;
    It is the bright, triumphal arch,
    Through which the saints to glory march.




377.              C. M.                 Bath Coll.

Prayer for Strong Faith.


1   O, for a faith that will not shrink
      Though pressed by every foe,
    That will not tremble on the brink
      Of any earthly woe!--

2   That will not murmur nor complain
      Beneath the chastening rod,
    But, in the hour of grief or pain,
      Will lean upon its God;--

3   A faith that shines more bright and clear
      When tempests rage without;
    That when in danger knows no fear,
      In darkness feels no doubt;--

4   Lord, give us such a faith as this,
      And then, whate'er may come,
    We'll taste, e'en here, the hallowed bliss
      Of an eternal home.




378.              C. M.                    Sidney.

Hope.


1   Borne o'er the ocean's stormy wave,
      The beacon's light appears,
    When yawns the seaman's watery grave,
      And his lone bosom cheers.

2   Then, should the raging ocean foam,
      His heart shall dauntless prove,
    To reach, secure, his cherished home,
      The haven of his love.

3   So, when the soul is wrapt in gloom,
      To worldly grief a prey,
    Thy beams, blest Hope, beyond the tomb,
      Illume the pilgrim's way.

4   They point to that serene abode
      Where holy faith shall rest,
    Protected by the sufferer's God,
      And be forever blest.




379.             7s. M.                   Cennick.

The Christian rejoicing in Hope.


1   Children of the Heavenly King,
    As ye journey, sweetly sing;
    Sing your Saviour's worthy praise,
    Glorious in his works and ways.

2   Ye are travelling home to God,
    In the way the fathers trod;
    They are happy now, and ye
    Soon their happiness shall see.

3   Shout, ye little flock, and blest;
    You on Jesus' throne shall rest;
    There your seat is now prepared,
    There your kingdom and reward.

4   Lord, submissive make us go,
    Ready, leaving all below;
    Only thou our Leader be,
    And we still will follow thee.




380.              C. M.              H. H. Hawley.

The Hope, the Star, the Voice.


1   There is a hope, a blesséd hope,
      More precious and more bright
    Than all the joyless mockery
      The world esteems delight.

2   There is a star, a lovely star,
      That lights the darkest gloom,
    And sheds a peaceful radiance o'er
      The prospects of the tomb.

3   There is a voice, a cheering voice,
      That lifts the soul above,
    Dispels the painful, anxious doubt,
      And whispers, "God is love."

4   That voice, aloud from Calvary's height,
      Proclaims the soul forgiven;
    That star is revelation's light;
      That hope, the hope of heaven.




381.              C. M.                   Drennan.

Law of Love.


1   All nature feels attractive power,
      A strong, embracing force;
    The drops that sparkle in the shower,
      The planets in their course.

2   Thus, in the universe of mind,
      Is felt the law of love;
    The charity both strong and kind,
      For all that live and move.

3   In this fine sympathetic chain
      All creatures bear a part;
    Their every pleasure, every pain,
      Linked to the feeling heart.

4   More perfect bond, the Christian plan
      Attaches soul to soul;
    Our neighbor is the suffering man,
      Though at the farthest pole.

5   To earth below, from heaven above,
      The faith in Christ professed,
    More clearly shows that God is love,
      And whom he loves is blessed.




382.              C. M.                 Doddridge.

The Same.


1   O, may our sympathizing breasts
      The generous pleasure know,
    Kindly to share in others' joy,
      And weep for others' woe!

2   Where'er the helpless sons of grief
      In low distress are laid,
    Soft be our hearts their pains to feel,
      And swift our hands to aid.

3   O, be the law of love fulfilled
      In every act and thought,
    Each angry passion far removed,
      Each selfish view forgot!

4   Be thou, my heart, dilated wide
      With this kind, social grace,
    And, in one grasp of fervent love,
      All earth and heaven embrace.




383.              C. M.                     Watts.

Love to God.


1   Happy the heart where graces reign,
      Where love inspires the breast:
    Love is the brightest of the train,
      And strengthens all the rest.

2   Knowledge--alas! 'tis all in vain,
      And all in vain our fear;
    Our stubborn sins will fight and reign,
      If love be absent there.

3   This is the grace that lives and sings,
      When faith and hope shall cease;
    'Tis this shall strike our joyful strings
      In realms of endless peace.

4   Before we quite forsake our clay,
      Or leave this dark abode,
    The wings of love bear us away
      To see our gracious God.




384.              L. M.                    Browne.

Love to all Mankind.


1   O God, my Father, and my King,
    Of all I have, or hope, the spring!
    Send down thy spirit from above,
    And fill my heart with heavenly love.

2   May I from every act abstain,
    That hurts or gives another pain:
    And bear a sympathizing part,
    Whene'er I meet a wounded heart.

3   And let my neighbor's prosperous state
    A mutual joy in me create;
    His virtuous triumph let me join;
    His peace and happiness be mine.

4   And though my neighbor's hate I prove,
    Still let me vanquish hate with love;
    And every secret wish suppress,
    That would abridge his happiness.

5   Let love through all my conduct shine,
    An image fair, though faint, of thine!
    Thus let me his disciple prove,
    Who came to manifest thy love.




385.              C. M.                    Roscoe.

The Two Commandments.


1   This is the first and great command--
      To love thy God above;
    And this the second--as thyself
      Thy neighbor thou shalt love.

2   Who is my neighbor? He who wants
      The help which thou canst give;
    And both the law and prophets say,
      This do, and thou shalt live.




386.              C. M.                     Watts.

Christ's Love to Enemies our Example.


1   God of our mercy and our praise,
      Thy glory is our song;
    We'll speak the honors of thy grace
      With a rejoicing tongue.

2   When Christ among the sons of men
      In humble form was found,
    With cruel slanders, false and vain,
      They compassed him around.

3   Their miseries his compassion moved,
      Their peace he still pursued;
    They rendered hatred for his love,
      And evil for his good.

4   Their malice raged without a cause;
      Yet, with his dying breath,
    He prayed for murderers on his cross,
      And blest his foes in death.

5   O, may his conduct, all divine,
      To us a model prove:
    Like his, O God, our hearts incline
      Our enemies to love.




387.              C. M.        Christian Psalmist.

Faith, Hope and Charity.


1   Faith, hope, and love, now dwell on earth,
      And earth by them is blest;
    But faith and hope must yield to love,
      Of all the graces best.

2   Hope shall to full fruition rise,
      And faith be sight above;
    These are the means, but this the end,
      For saints forever love.




388.              L. M.                Montgomery.

The Christian Graces.


1   Faith, hope, and charity, these three,
    Yet is the greatest charity;
    Father of lights, these gifts impart
    To mine and every human heart.

2   Faith, that in prayer can never fail,
    Hope, that o'er doubting must prevail,
    And charity, whose name above
    Is God's own name, for God is love.

3   The morning star is lost in light,
    Faith vanishes at perfect sight,
    The rainbow passes with the storm
    And hope with sorrow's fading form.

4   But charity, serene, sublime,
    Beyond the reach of death and time,
    Like the blue sky's all-bounding space,
    Holds heaven and earth in its embrace.




389.              C. M.                     Watts.

A Living and a Dead Faith.


1   Mistaken souls! that dream of heaven,
      And make their empty boast
    Of inward joys, and sins forgiven,
      While they are slaves to lust.

2   Vain are our fancies, airy flights,
      If faith be cold and dead;
    None but a living power unites
      To Christ the living head.

3   'T is faith that purifies the heart;
      'T is faith that works by love;
    That bids all sinful joys depart,
      And lifts the thoughts above.

4   This faith shall every fear control
      By its celestial power,
    With holy triumph fill the soul
      In death's approaching hour.




390.              L. M.                     Scott.

"Two men went up into the temple to pray."


1   The uplifted eye, and bended knee,
    Are but vain homage, Lord, to thee;
    In vain our lips thy praise prolong,
    The heart a stranger to the song.

2   The pure, the humble, contrite mind,
    Sincere, and to thy will resigned,
    To thee a nobler offering yields,
    Than Sheba's groves, or Sharon's fields.

3   Love God and man--this great command,
    Doth on eternal pillars stand;
    This did thine ancient prophets teach,
    And this thy Well-Belovéd preach.




391.              H. M.                Montgomery.

Brotherly Love.  Ps. 133.


1     How beautiful the sight
        Of brethren who agree
      In friendship to unite,
        And bonds of charity!
    'T is like the precious ointment shed
    O'er all his robes from Aaron's head.

2     'Tis like the dews that fill
        The cups of Hermon's flowers;
      Or Zion's fruitful hill,
        Bright with the drops of showers;
    When mingling odors breathe around,
    And glory rests on all the ground.

3     For there the Lord commands
        Blessings, a boundless store,
      From his unsparing hands,
        Yea, life for evermore.
    Thrice happy they who meet above
    To spend eternity in love!

The Harmony of Love.


1   Lord! subdue our selfish will;
      Each to each our tempers suit,
    By thy modulating skill,
      Heart to heart, as lute to lute.

2   Sweetly on our spirits move;
      Gently touch the trembling strings:
    Make the harmony of love,
      Music for the King of kings!




393.              S. M.                     Watts.

The Bond of Peace.


1     Blest are the sons of peace,
      Whose hearts and hopes are one;
    Whose kind designs to serve and please
      Through all their actions run.

2     Blest is the pious house
      Where zeal and friendship meet;
    Their songs of praise, their mingled vows,
      Make their communion sweet.

3     Thus on the heavenly hills
      The saints are blest above,
    Where joy like morning dew distils,
      And all the air is love.




394.              C. M.                Montgomery.

"The unity of the spirit in the bond of peace."


1   The glorious universe around,
      The heavens with all their train,
    Sun, moon, and stars, are firmly bound
      In one mysterious chain.

2   The earth, the ocean, and the sky,
      To form one world agree,
    Where all that walk, or swim, or fly,
      Compose one family.

3   In one fraternal bond of love,
      One fellowship of mind,
    The saints below and saints above
      Their bliss and glory find.

4   Here in their house of pilgrimage,
      Thy statutes are their song;
    There, through one bright, eternal age,
      Thy praises they prolong.

The Church on Earth and in Heaven, One.


1   The saints on earth and those above
      But one communion make:
    Joined to their Lord in bonds of love,
      All of his grace partake.

2   One family, we dwell in him;
      One church above, beneath;
    Though now divided by the stream,
      The swelling stream of death.

3   One army of the living God,--
      To his command we bow;
    Part of the host have crossed the flood,
      And part are crossing now.

4   O God, be thou our constant guide!
      And when the word is given,
    Sustain us o'er the fearful tide,
      And bring us safe to heaven.

Christian Unity.


1     Let party names no more
      The Christian world o'erspread;
    Gentile and Jew, and bond and free,
      Are one in Christ their head.

2     Among the saints on earth
      Let mutual love be found;
    Heirs of the same inheritance,
      With mutual blessings crowned.

3     Let envy and ill-will
      Be banished far away;
    Those should in holy friendship dwell,
      Who the same Lord obey.

4     Thus will the church below
      Resemble that above;
    Where streams of pleasure always flow,
      And every heart is love.




397.              L. M.                  Barbauld.

Christian Friendship.


1   How blest the sacred tie that binds
    In union sweet according minds!
    How swift the heavenly course they run,
    Whose hearts, and faith, and hopes are one!

2   To each the soul of each how dear!
    What jealous love, what holy fear!
    How doth the generous flame within
    Refine from earth, and cleanse from sin!

3   Their streaming eyes together flow
    For human guilt and mortal woe;
    Their ardent prayers together rise
    Like mingling flames in sacrifice.

4   Together shall they seek the place
    Where God reveals his awful face:
    How high, how strong, their raptures swell
    There's none but kindred souls can tell.

Charitable Judgment.


1   Omniscient God, 'tis thine to know
    The springs whence wrong opinions flow;
    To judge from principles within,
    When frailty errs, and when we sin.

2   Who with another's eye can read,
    Or worship by another's creed?
    Revering thy command alone,
    We humbly seek and use our own.

3   If wrong, forgive; accept, if right,
    Whilst faithful, we obey our light,
    And judging none, are zealous still
    To follow, as to learn, thy will.

4   When shall our happy eyes behold
    Thy people, fashioned in thy mould?
    And charity our kindred prove
    Derived from thee, O God of love?




399.              L. M.                     Watts.

The Same.


1   Not different food, nor different dress,
      Compose the kingdom of our Lord;
    But peace, and joy, and righteousness,
      Faith, and obedience to his word.

2   When weaker Christians we despise,
      We do the gospel mighty wrong;
    For God, the gracious and the wise,
      Receives the feeble with the strong.

3   Let pride and wrath be banished hence,
      Meekness and love our souls pursue,
    Nor shall our practice give offence
      To saints, the Gentile or the Jew.




400.              S. M.                     Scott.

Private Judgment and Accountability.


1     Imposture shrinks from light,
      And dreads the curious eye;
    But sacred truths the test invite,
      They bid us search and try.

2     With understanding blest,
      Created to be free,
    Our faith on man we dare not rest,
      Subject to none but thee.

3     Lord, give the light we need;
      With soundest knowledge fill;
    From noxious error guard our creed,
      From prejudice our will.

4     The truth thou shalt impart,
      May we with firmness own;
    Abhorring each evasive art,
      And fearing thee alone.




401.              C. M.                    Newton.

True Zeal.


1   Zeal is that pure and heavenly flame
      The fire of love supplies;
    Whilst that which often bears the name,
      Is self but in disguise.

2   True zeal is merciful and mild,
      Can pity and forbear;
    The false is headstrong, fierce and wild,
      And breathes revenge and war.

3   While zeal for truth the Christian warms,
      He knows the worth of peace;
    But self contends for names and forms,
      Its party to increase.

4   Zeal has attained its highest aim,
      Its end is satisfied,
    If sinners love the Saviour's name,--
      Nor seeks it aught beside.

5   This idol self, O Lord, dethrone,
      And from our hearts remove;
    And let no zeal by us be shown
      But that which springs from love.




402.              C. M.                   Needham.

Moderation.


1   Happy the man whose cautious steps
      Still keep the golden mean;
    Whose life by wisdom's rules well formed,
      Declares a conscience clean.

2   To sect or party his large soul
      Disdains to be confined;
    The good he loves of every name,
      And prays for all mankind.

3   His business is to keep his heart;
      Each passion to control;
    Nobly ambitious well to rule
      The empire of his soul.

4   Not on the world his heart is set,
      His treasure is above;
    Nothing beneath the sovereign good
      Can claim his highest love.




403.              L. M.             Sir H. Wotton.

The Independent and Happy Man.


1   How happy is he born or taught,
      Who serveth not another's will;
    Whose armor is his honest thought,
      And simple truth his highest skill;

2   Whose passions not his masters are;
      Whose soul is still prepared for death;
    Not tied unto the world with care
      Of prince's ear or vulgar breath;

3   Who God doth late and early pray
      More of his grace than goods to lend,
    And walks with man from day to day,
      As with a brother and a friend.

4   This man is freed from servile bands
      Of hope to rise, or fear to fall;
    Lord of himself, though not of lands,
      And having nothing, yet hath all.




404.              C. M.                     Logan.

Wisdom.


1   O happy is the man, who hears
      Instruction's warning voice;
    And who celestial wisdom makes
      His early, only choice.

2   Her treasures are of more esteem
      Than east or west unfold;
    And her rewards more precious are
      Than all their mines of gold.

3   In her right hand she holds to view
      A length of happy days;
    Riches with splendid honors joined,
      Her left hand full displays.

4   She guides the young with innocence
      In pleasure's path to tread;
    A crown of glory she bestows
      Upon the hoary head.

5   According as her labors rise,
      So her rewards increase;
    Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
      And all her paths are peace.




405.              C. M.           Campbell's Coll.

"They shall walk and not faint."


1   Mere human power shall fast decay,
      And youthful vigor cease;
    But they who wait upon the Lord
      In strength shall still increase.

2   They with unwearied feet shall tread
      The path of life divine,
    With growing ardor onward move,
      With growing brightness shine.

3   On eagles' wings they mount, they soar;
      Their wings are faith and love;
    Till, past the cloudy regions here,
      They rise to heaven above.




406.              C. M.                     Watts.

Hidden Life of the Christian.


1   O happy soul that lives on high,
      While men lie grovelling here!
    His hopes are fixed above the sky,
      And faith forbids his fear.

2   His conscience knows no secret stings,
      While grace and joy combine
    To form a life whose holy springs
      Are hidden and divine.

3   He waits in secret on his God;
      His God in secret sees;
    Let earth be all in arms abroad,
      He dwells in heavenly peace.

4   His pleasures rise from things unseen,
      Beyond this world and time;
    Where neither eyes nor ears have been,
      Nor thoughts of mortals climb.

5   He wants no pomp nor royal throne
      To raise his honors here;
    Content and pleased to live unknown,
      Till Christ, his life, appear.




407.             8s. M.                 C. Wesley.

"That they also may be one in us."


1   Lord, from whom all blessings flow,
    Perfecting the church below!
    Steadfast may we cleave to thee;
    Love the mystic union be.
    Join our faithful spirits, join
    Each to each, and all to thine:
    Lead us through the paths of peace,
    On to perfect holiness.

2   Sweetly may we all agree,
    Touched with softest sympathy:
    There is neither bond nor free,
    Great nor servile, Lord, in thee;
    Love, like death, hath all destroyed
    Rendered all distinctions void!
    Names, and sects, and parties fall:
    Thou, O Christ, art all in all!




408.              S. M.                    Steele.

Religion a Support in Life.


1     Religion can assuage
      The tempest of the soul;
    And every fear shall lose its rage
      At her divine control.

2     Through life's bewildered way,
      Her hand unerring leads;
    And o'er the path her heavenly ray
      A cheering lustre sheds.

3     When reason, tired and blind,
      Sinks helpless and afraid,
    Thou blest supporter of the mind,
      How powerful is thine aid!

4     O, let us feel thy power,
      And find thy sweet relief,
    To brighten every gloomy hour
      And soften every grief.




409.              C. M.              Tate & Brady.

The Righteous and the Wicked.


1   How blest is he, who ne'er consents
      By ill advice to walk;
    Nor stands in sinners' ways, nor sits
      Where men profanely talk:

2   But makes the perfect law of God
      His business and delight;
    Devoutly reads therein by day,
      And meditates by night.

3   Like some fair tree, which, fed by streams,
      With timely fruit does bend,
    He still shall flourish, and success
      All his designs attend.

4   Ungodly men, and their attempts,
      No lasting root shall find;
    Untimely blasted, and dispersed
      Like chaff before the wind.




410.              C. M.               Exeter Coll.

The Influence of Habitual Piety.


1   Blest is the man who fears the Lord!
      His well established mind,
    In every varying scene of life,
      Shall true composure find.

2   Oft through the deep and stormy sea
      The heavenly footsteps lie;
    But on a glorious world beyond
      His faith can fix its eye.

3   Though dark his present prospects be,
      And sorrows round him dwell,
    Yet hope can whisper to his soul,
      That all shall issue well.

4   Full in the presence of his God,
      Through every scene he goes;
    And, fearing him, no other fear
      His steadfast bosom knows.




411.              C. M.                     Proud.

The Happiness of a Christian.


1   When true religion gains a place,
      And lives within the mind,
    The sensual life subdued by grace,
      And all the soul refined:

2   The desert blooms in living green,
      Where thorns and briers grew;
    The barren waste is fruitful seen,
      And all the prospect new.

3   O happy Christian, richly blessed!
      What floods of pleasure roll!
    By God and man he stands confessed,
      In dignity of soul.

4   Substantial, pure, his every joy:
      His Maker is his friend;
    The noblest business his employ,
      And happiness his end.




412.          7s. & 8s. M.                Bowring.

"He that walketh uprightly, walketh surely."


1   He who walks in virtue's way,
      Firm and fearless, walketh surely;
    Diligent, while yet 'tis day,
      On he speeds, and speeds securely.

2   Flowers of peace beneath him grow,
      Suns of pleasure brighten o'er him;
    Memory's joys behind him go,
      Hope's sweet angels fly before him.

3   Thus he moves from stage to stage,
      Smiles of earth and heaven attending;
    Softly sinking down in age,
      And at last to death descending.

4   Cradled in its quiet deep,
      Calm as summer's loveliest even,
    He shall sleep the hallowed sleep;
      Sleep that is o'erwatched by Heaven.




413.              C. M.                     Burns.

The Happiness of the Righteous.


1   The man, in life wherever placed,
      Hath happiness in store,
    Who walks not in the wicked's way,
      Nor learns their guilty lore:

2   Nor from the seat of scornful pride
      Casts forth his eyes abroad,
    But with humility and awe,
      Still walks before his God.

3   That man shall flourish like the trees
      Which by the streamlets grow;
    The fruitful top is spread on high,
      And firm the root below.

4   But he whose blossom buds in guilt
      Shall to the ground be cast,
    And, like the rootless stubble, tossed
      Before the sweeping blast.




414.              L. M.                     Keble.

"Not that thou wouldst take them out of the world, but keep them from its
evil."


1   Sweet is the bliss of souls serene,
    When they have sworn and steadfast mean,
    Counting the cost, in all t' espy
    Their God, in all themselves deny.

2   O could we learn that sacrifice,
    What lights would all around us rise!
    How would our hearts with wisdom talk,
    Along life's dullest, dreariest walk!

3   We need not bid, for cloistered cell,
    Our neighbor and our work farewell,
    Nor strive to wind ourselves too high
    For sinful man beneath the sky:

4   The trivial round, the common task,
    Would furnish all we ought to ask;
    Room to deny ourselves; a road
    To bring us, daily, nearer God.




415.          7s. & 6s. M.                 Cowper.

Joy and Peace in Believing.


1   Sometimes a light surprises
      The Christian while he sings:
    It is the Lord, who rises
      With healing in his wings:
    When comforts are declining,
      He grants the soul again
    A season of clear shining,
      To cheer it after rain.

2   In holy contemplation,
      We sweetly then pursue
    The theme of God's salvation,
      And find it ever new:
    Set free from present sorrow,
      We cheerfully can say,
    "E'en let the unknown morrow
      Bring with it what it may."

3   It can bring with it nothing,
      But he will bear us through:
    Who gives the lilies clothing,
      Will clothe his people too:
    Beneath the spreading heavens,
      No creature but is fed;
    And he who feeds the ravens,
      Will give his children bread.

4   Though vine, nor fig tree neither,
      Its wonted fruit should bear;
    Though all the field should wither,
      Nor flocks, nor herds be there:
    Yet God the same abiding,
      His praise shall tune my voice;
    For while in him confiding,
      I cannot but rejoice.

For a Right Spirit.


1     I want a sober mind,
      A self-renouncing will,
    That tramples down and casts behind
      The baits of pleasing ill;
      A soul inured to pain,
      To hardship, grief and loss,
    Bold to take up, firm to sustain
      The consecrated cross.

2     I want a godly fear,
      A quick-discerning eye,
    That looks to thee when sin is near,
      And sees the tempter fly;
      A spirit still prepared,
      And armed with jealous care,
    Forever standing on its guard,
      And watching unto prayer.

3     I want a true regard,
      A single, steady aim,
    Unmoved by threatening or reward,
      To thee and thy great name;
      A zealous, just concern
      For thine immortal praise;
    A pure desire that all may learn
      And glorify thy grace.

Heavenly Joy on Earth.


1     Come, ye that love the Lord,
      And let your joys be known;
    Join in a song with sweet accord,
      And thus surround the throne.

2     The sorrows of the mind
      Be banished from the place!
    Religion never was designed
      To make our pleasures less.

3     The men of grace have found
      Glory begun below;
    Celestial fruits on earthly ground
      From faith and hope may grow.

4     The hill of Sion yields
      A thousand sacred sweets,
    Before we reach the heavenly fields,
      Or walk the golden streets.

5     Then let our songs abound,
      And every tear be dry;
    We're marching through Immanuel's ground,
      To fairer worlds on high.

Where is Heaven?


1     Our heaven is everywhere,
      If we but love the Lord,
    Unswerving tread the narrow way,
      And ever shun the broad.

2     'T is where the trusting heart
      Bows meekly to its grief,
    Still looking up with earnest faith
      For comfort and relief.

3     Where guileless infancy
      In happiness doth dwell,
    And where the aged one can say
      "He hath done all things well."

4     Wherever truth abides
      Sweet peace is ever there;
    If we but love and serve the Lord,
      Our heaven is everywhere.

Heaven Here.


1   Heaven is here; its hymns of gladness
      Cheer the true believer's way,
    In this world where sin and sadness
      Often change to night our day.

2   Heaven is here; where misery lightened
      Of its heavy load is seen,
    Where the face of sorrow brightened
      By the deed of love hath been:

3   Where the bound, the poor, despairing
      Are set free, supplied and blest;
    Where, in others' anguish sharing,
      We can find our surest rest.

4   Where we heed the voice of duty
      Rather than man's praise, or rod;
    This is heaven,--its peace, its beauty,
      Radiant with the smile of God.

God's Kingdom Here.


1   Oh, where, our Saviour! sweeps the line
      That marks thy kingdom's holy reign?
    Is it where northern meteors shine
      Or gilds the cross the southern main?
    Where breaks the dawn o'er spicy lands?
    Or twilight sleeps on desert sands?

2   Is it where sunny skies grow dim
      With smoke of heathen sacrifice?
    Or where, in costly domes, the hymn
      Is taught on incense clouds to rise?
    Nay, nay, thy blessed word has shown
    Thy kingdom is the heart alone!

3   That solemn world, whose bounds between
      Life's mysteries of birth and death,
    Are filled with warring hosts unseen,
      Beings of power, though not of breath--
    The spirit realm, where'er it be,
    Is the dominion swayed by thee.

4   Wild, phantom shapes of gloom and fear,
      Roam dimly through the haunted spot,
    And earth holds not a land so drear
      As the sad heart that owns thee not,
    Where sorrows wound and pleasures pall,
    And death's dread shadow darkens all.

5   But lift thy sceptre there, its bowers
      Shall be serene and sweet and fair,
    And, as in time's primeval hours,
      The holy ones shall gather there,
    And heaven's own peace the soul o'erflow,
    E'en while it lingers here below.

The Heaven Within.


1   As earth's pageant passes by,
    Let reflection turn thine eye
    Inward, and observe thy breast;
    There alone dwells solid rest.

2   That's a close immured tower,
    Which can mock all hostile power;
    To thyself a tenant be,
    And inhabit safe and free.

3   Say not that this house is small,
    Girt up in a narrow wall;
    In a cleanly, sober mind,
    Heaven itself full room doth find.

4   The infinite Creator can
    Dwell in it; and may not man?
    Here, content, make thy abode
    With thyself and with thy God.




DEVOUT EXERCISES.




422.              C. M.            H. M. Williams.

Habitual Devotion.


1   While thee I seek, protecting Power!
      Be my vain wishes stilled;
    And may this consecrated hour
      With better hopes be filled.

2   Thy love the power of thought bestowed;
      To thee my thoughts would soar;
    Thy mercy o'er my life has flowed--
      That mercy I adore!

3   In each event of life, how clear
      Thy ruling hand I see!
    Each blessing to my soul more dear,
      Because conferred by thee.

4   In every joy that crowns my days,
      In every pain I bear,
    My heart shall find delight in praise,
      Or seek relief in prayer.

5   When gladness wings my favored hour,
      Thy love my thoughts shall fill;
    Resigned, when storms of sorrow lower,
      My soul shall meet thy will.

6   My lifted eye, without a tear,
      The gathering storm shall see;
    My steadfast heart shall know no fear;--
      That heart shall rest on thee!




423.              L. M.                   Bowring.

Perpetual Praise.


1   When, wakened by thy voice of power,
      The hour of morning beams in light,
    My voice shall sing that morning hour,
      And thee, who mad'st that hour so bright.

2   The morning strengthens into noon;
      Earth's fairest beauties shine more fair;
    And noon and morning shall attune
      My grateful heart to praise and prayer.

3   When 'neath the evening western gate
      The sun's retiring rays are hid,
    My joy shall be to meditate,
      E'en as the pious patriarch did.

4   As twilight wears a darker hue,
      And gathering night creation dims,
    The twilight and the midnight, too,
      Shall have their harmonies and hymns.

5   So shall sweet thoughts, and thoughts sublime,
      My constant inspirations be;
    And every shifting scene of time
      Reflect, my God, a light from thee.

Secret Prayer.


1   I love to steal awhile away
      From every cumbering care,
    And spend the hours of setting day
      In humble, grateful prayer.

2   I love to think on mercies past,
      And future good implore,
    And all my cares and sorrows cast
      On him whom I adore.

3   I love by faith to take a view
      Of brighter scenes in heaven;
    The prospect doth my strength renew,
      While here by tempests driven.

4   Thus, when life's toilsome day is o'er,
      May its departing ray
    Be calm as this impressive hour,
      And lead to endless day.

Prayer for Self-Consecration.


1     O God, my strength, my hope,
      On thee I cast my care,
    With humble confidence look up,
      And know thou hearest prayer.

2     O, for a godly fear,
      A quick-discerning eye,
    That looks to thee when sin is near,
      And sees the tempter fly!--

3     A spirit still prepared,
      And armed with jealous care,
    Forever standing on its guard,
      And watching unto prayer!

4     Lord, let me still abide,
      Nor from my hope remove,
    Till thou my patient spirit guide
      To better worlds above.

Breathings of Grace.


1   Like morning, when her early breeze
    Breaks up the surface of the seas,
    That, in their furrows, dark with night,
    Her hand may sow the seeds of light;

2   Thy grace can send its breathings o'er
    The spirit, dark and lost before;
    And freshening all its depths, prepare
    For truth divine to enter there!

3   Till David touched his sacred lyre,
    In silence lay the unbreathing wire;
    But when he swept its chords along,

4   So sleeps the soul, till thou, O Lord,

    Till, waked by thee, its breath shall rise
    In music worthy of the skies.

Dependence on God.


1     To keep the lamp alive,
      With oil we fill the bowl;
    'T is water makes the willow thrive,
      And grace that feeds the soul.

2     The Lord's unsparing hand
      Supplies the living stream;
    It is not at our own command,
      But still derived from him.

3     Man's wisdom is to seek
      His strength in God alone;
    And e'en an angel would be weak,
      Who trusted in his own.

4     Retreat beneath his wings,
      And in his grace confide;
    This more exalts the King of kings
      Than all your works beside.

5     In God is all our store,
      Grace issues from his throne;
    Whoever says, "I want no more,"
      Confesses he has none.

The Soul panting for God.


1   As the hart, with eager looks,
    Panteth for the water-brooks,
    So my soul, athirst for thee,
    Pants the living God to see;
    When, O when, with filial fear,
    Lord, shall I to thee draw near?

2   Why art thou cast down, my soul?
    God, thy God, shall make thee whole:
    Why art thou disquieted?
    God shall lift thy fallen head,
    And his countenance benign
    Be the saving health of thine.

Wisdom and Virtue sought from God.


1   Supreme and universal Light!
    Fountain of reason! Judge of right!
    Parent of good! whose blessings flow
    On all above, and all below:

2   Assist us, Lord, to act, to be,
    What nature and thy laws decree;
    Worthy that intellectual flame,
    Which from thy breathing spirit came!

3   May our expanded souls disclaim
    The narrow view, the selfish aim;
    But with a Christian zeal embrace
    Whate'er is friendly to our race.

4   O Father, grace and virtue grant!
    No more we wish, no more we want:
    To know, to serve thee, and to love,
    Is peace below,--is bliss above.

Holy Resignation.


1   Author of good, to thee we turn:
      Thine ever wakeful eye
    Alone can all our wants discern,
      Thy hand alone supply.

2   O, let thy love within us dwell,
      Thy fear our footsteps guide;
    That love shall vainer loves expel,
      That fear all fears beside.

3   And, O, by error's force subdued,
      Since oft, with stubborn will,
    We blindly shun the latent good,
      And grasp the specious ill,--

4   Not what we wish, but what we want,
      Let mercy still supply:
    The good we ask not; Father, grant;
      The ill we ask, deny.

Prayer for the Comforter.


1   I want the spirit of power within,
      Of love, and of a healthful mind;
    Of power to conquer every sin,
      Of love to God and all mankind;
    Of health that pain and death defies,
    Most vigorous when the body dies.

2   O that the Comforter would come,
      Nor visit as a transient guest,
    But fix in me his constant home,
      And keep possession of my breast;
    And make my soul his loved abode,
    The temple of indwelling God!

A Peaceful Conscience.


1   While some in folly's pleasures roll,
    And court the joys that hurt the soul,
    Be mine that silent, calm repast,
    A conscience peaceful to the last.

2   With this companion in the shade,
    My soul no more shall be dismayed;
    But fearless meet life's dreariest gloom,
    And the pale monarch of the tomb.

3   Amidst the various scenes of ills,
    Each blow some kind design fulfils;
    And can I murmur at my God,
    While love supreme directs the rod?

4   His hand will smooth my rugged way,
    And lead me to the realms of day;
    To milder skies, and brighter plains,
    Where everlasting pleasure reigns.




433.              L. M.                     Watts.

Self-knowledge, and Abstraction from Earth.


1   My God, permit me not to be
    A stranger to myself and thee:
    Amidst a thousand thoughts I rove,
    Forgetful of my highest love.

2   Why should my passions mix with earth,
    And thus debase my heavenly birth?
    Why should I cleave to things below,
    And let my God, my Saviour go?

3   Call me away from flesh and sense;
    Thy sovereign word can draw me thence:
    I would obey the voice divine,
    And all inferior joys resign.

4   Be earth, with all her scenes, withdrawn,
    Let noise and vanity be gone:
    In secret silence of the mind,
    My heaven, and there my God, I find.

Rising towards Heaven.


1   Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
      Thy better portion trace;
    Rise from transitory things,
      Towards heaven, thy native place:
    Sun, and moon, and stars decay,
      Time shall soon this earth remove;
    Rise, my soul, and haste away
      To seats prepared above.

2   Rivers to the ocean run,
      Nor stay in all their course;
    Fire ascending seeks the sun,--
      Both speed them to their source:
    So a soul that's born of God
      Pants to view his glorious face,
    Upward tends to his abode,
      To rest in his embrace.

    Haven to take the shipwrecked in,
    My everlasting rest from sin!

2   Come, O my comfort and delight!
      My strength and health, and shield, and sun
    My boast, my confidence, and might,
      My joy, my glory, and my crown;
    My gospel-hope, my calling's prize,

1   How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
      In a believer's ear!
    It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
      And drives away his fear.

2   It makes the wounded spirit whole,
      It calms the troubled breast;
    'T is manna to the hungry soul,
      And, to the weary, rest.

3   Weak is the effort of my heart,
      And cold my warmest thought,
    But when I see thee as thou art,
      I'll praise thee as I ought.

4   Till then I would thy love proclaim,
      With every fleeting breath;
    And may the music of thy name
      Refresh my soul in death.

    As saints and seraphim fulfil
      Thy perfect law above.

3   Our daily bread supply,
      While by thy word we live;
    The guilt of our iniquity
      Forgive, as we forgive.

4   From dark temptation's power
      Our feeble hearts defend;
    Deliver in the evil hour,
      And guide us to the end.

      Glory and power divine;
    The sceptre, throne, and majesty
      Of heaven and earth are thine.

    Thou canst, thou dost, to blessings turn.

    And though withdrawn thy gifts should be
    In all things I'll give thanks to thee.

    From him who loves us; let us pray.

Imploring the constant Presence of God.

    Her father's God before her moved,

      The cloudy pillar glided slow;
    By night, Arabia's crimsoned sands
      Returned the fiery column's glow.

3   Thus, present still, though now unseen,
      When brightly shines the prosperous day,
    Be thoughts of thee a cloudy screen,
      To temper the deceitful ray!

4   And O, when gathers on our path,
      In shade and storm, the frequent night,
    Be thou, long-suffering, slow to wrath,

      Of pride, or fond desire;
    To catch the wandering of my will,
      And quench the kindling fire.

3   From thee that I no more may part,
      No more thy goodness grieve,
    The filial awe, the fleshly heart,
      The tender conscience give.

4   Quick as the apple of the eye,

      Of sinful passion free,
    Aloft through faith's serener air
      To hold my course to thee.

      Sin is mixed with all I do;
    You that love the Lord indeed,
      Tell me, is it thus with you?

4   Yet I mourn my stubborn will,
      Find my sin a grief and thrall;
    Should I grieve for what I feel,
      If I did not love at all?

5   Father, let me love thee more,

    If I have not loved before,
      Help me to begin to-day.

2   Engage this roving, treacherous heart,
    Wisely to choose the better part;

3   Then let the wildest storms arise,
    Let tempests mingle earth with skies,
    No fatal shipwreck shall I fear,
    But all my treasures with me bear.

    Secure, when mortal comforts flee,
    To find ten thousand worlds in thee.

Sincerity and Hypocrisy.


1   God is a spirit just and wise,
      He sees our inmost mind;
    In vain to heaven we raise our cries,

2   Nothing but truth before his throne
      With honor can appear;
    The painted hypocrites are known
      Through the disguise they wear.

3   Their lifted eyes salute the skies,
      Their bending knees the ground;
    But God abhors the sacrifice
      Where not the heart is found.

4   Lord, search my thoughts, and try my ways,
      And make my soul sincere;

      And find my way to heaven.

For the Understanding and Influence of God's Word.


1   While here as wandering sheep we stray,
    Teach us, O teach us, Lord, thy way!
    Dispose our hearts, with willing awe,
    To love thy word, to keep thy law;
    That, by thy guiding precepts led,
    Our feet the paths of truth may tread.

2   Great Source of light to all below!
    Teach us thy holy will to know:
    Teach us to read thy word aright,
    And make it our supreme delight;
    That, purged from vain desires, our mind
    In thee its only good may find.

3   Maker, instructer, judge of all,
    O hear us when on thee we call!
    To us, all-bounteous Lord, dispense
    Thy grace, and guiding influence!
    Preserve us in thy holy ways,
    And teach our hearts to speak thy praise!

Solomon's Prayer for Wisdom.


1   Almighty God! in humble prayer
      To thee our souls we lift;
    Do thou our waiting minds prepare
      For thy most needful gift.

2   We ask not golden streams of wealth
      Along our path to flow;
    We ask not undecaying health,
      Nor length of years below.

3   We ask not honors, which an hour
      May bring and take away;
    We ask not pleasure, pomp, and power,
      Lest we should go astray.

4   We ask for wisdom;--Lord, impart
      The knowledge how to live;
    A wise and understanding heart
      To all before thee give.

5   The young remember thee in youth,
      Before the evil days!
    The old be guided by thy truth
      In wisdom's pleasant ways!

Walking with God.


1   O, for a closer walk with God!
      A calm and heavenly frame!
    A light to shine upon the road
      That leads me to the Lamb!

2   What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!
      How sweet their memory still!
    But now I find an aching void
      The world can never fill.

3   Return, O holy Dove, return,
      Sweet messenger of rest;
    I hate the sins that made thee mourn,
      And drove thee from my breast.

4   The dearest idol I have known,
      Whate'er that idol be,
    Help me to tear it from thy throne,
      And worship only thee.

For Freedom from Secret Sin.


1   Searcher of hearts! before thy face
      I all my soul display;
    And, conscious of its innate arts,
      Entreat thy strict survey.

2   If, lurking in its inmost folds,
      I any sin conceal,
    O, let a ray of light divine
      The secret guile reveal.

3   If tinctured with that odious gall
      Unknowing I remain,
    Let grace, like a pure silver stream,
      Wash out the hateful stain.

4   If, in these fatal fetters bound,
      A wretched slave I lie,
    Smite off my chains, and wake my soul
      To light and liberty.

5   To humble penitence and prayer
      Be gentle pity given;
    Speak ample pardon to my heart,
      And seal its claim to heaven.

Self-abandonment to God.


1     Lord! bring me to resign
      My doubting heart to thee;
    And, whether cheerful or distressed,
      Thine, thine alone to be.

2     My only aim be this,--
      Thy purpose to fulfil,
    In thee rejoice with all my strength,
      And do thy holy will.

3     Lord! thy all-seeing eye
      Keeps watch with sleepless care:
    Thy great compassion never fails;
      Thou hear'st my needy prayer.

4     So will I firmly trust,
      That thou wilt guide me still,
    And guard me safe throughout the way
      That leads to Zion's hill.

Religious Retirement.


1   Far from the world, O Lord! I flee,
      From strife and tumult far;
    From scenes, where sin is waging still
      Its most successful war.

2   The calm retreat, the silent shade,
      With prayer and praise agree;
    And seem, by thy sweet bounty, made
      For those who follow thee.

3   There, if thy spirit touch the soul,
      And grace her mean abode;
    O with what peace, and joy, and love,
      She communes with her God.

4   There, like the nightingale, she pours
      Her solitary lays;
    Nor asks a witness of her song,
      Nor thirsts for human praise.

5   Author and Guardian of my life,
      Sweet Source of light divine,
    And all harmonious names in one,
      My Father--thou art mine!

Silent Worship.


1   Let deepest silence all around
      Its peaceful shelter spread;
    So shall the living word abound,
      The word that wakes the dead.

2   How sweet to wait upon the Lord
      In stillness and in prayer!
    What though no preacher speak the word
      A minister is there:

3   He knows to bend the heart of steel,
      He bows the loftiest soul;
    O'er all we think and all we feel,
      How matchless his control!

4   And, O, how precious is his love
      In tender mercy given;
    It whispers of the blest above,
      And stays the soul on heaven.

5   From mind to mind, in streams of joy,
      The holy influence spreads;
    'T is peace, 'tis praise without alloy,
      For God that influence sheds.

6   To thee, O God, we still will pray,
      And praise thee as before;
    For this thy glorious gospel-day,
      Teach us to praise thee more.

"Help thou my unbelief."


1   If listening, as I listen still,
      O God! to thine instructive word,
    In spite of all my spirit's will,
      Some whispering voice of doubt is heard,--
    That voice spontaneous from the soul,
    Which nought can check and nought control;

2   If when most earnestly I pray
      For light, for aid, for strength from thee,
    Some struggling thoughts will force their way,
      And break my soul's serenity;--
    If reason, thy best gift, will hold
    The sceptre only half controlled:--

3   Help and forgive! heaven's alphabet
      Hath many a word of mystery;
    I read not all thy record yet,
      Though perseveringly I try;
    But teach me, Lord! and none shall be
    More prompt, more pleased to learn of thee.

Doing all to the Glory of God.


1     Teach me, my God and King,
      In all things thee to see;
    And what I do in anything,
      To do it as for thee!

2     To scorn the senses' sway,
      While still to thee I tend;
    In all I do be thou the way,--
      In all be thou the end.

3     All may of thee partake:
      Nothing so small can be,
    But draws, when acted for thy sake,
      Greatness and worth from thee.

4     If done beneath thy laws,
      Even servile labors shine;
    Hallowed is toil, if this the cause,
      The meanest work divine.

God the Pilgrim's Guide and Strength.


1   Guide me, O thou great Jehovah,
      Pilgrim through this mortal land:
    I am weak, but thou art mighty;
      Hold me with thy powerful hand:
          Bread of heaven,
      Feed me till I want no more.

2   Open now the crystal fountain,
      Whence the healing streams do flow;
    Let the fiery, cloudy pillar
      Lead me all my journey through:
          Strong Deliverer,
      Be thou still my strength and shield.

3   When I tread the verge of Jordan,
      Bid my anxious fears subside;
    Bear me through the swelling current;
      Land me safe on Canaan's side:
          Songs of praises
      I will ever give to thee.

1   Lord! I believe; thy power I own,
      Thy word I would obey;
    I wander comfortless, and lone,
      When from thy truth I stray.

2   Lord! I believe; but gloomy fears
      Sometimes bedim my sight;
    I look to thee with prayers and tears,
      And cry for strength and light.

3   Lord! I believe; but oft, I know,
      My faith is cold and weak;
    Strengthen my weakness, and bestow
      The confidence I seek!

4   Yes, I believe; and only thou
      Canst give my soul relief;
    Lord! to thy truth my spirit bow,
      Help thou my unbelief!

    Helpless and far from all relief,
      To heaven I lift mine eyes.

2   O lead me to the rock
      That's high above my head;
    And make the covert of thy wings
      My shelter and my shade.

3   Within thy presence, Lord,
      I ever would abide;
    Thou art the tower of my defence,
      The refuge where I hide.

2   When, harassed by ten thousand foes,
      Our helplessness we feel,
    O, give the weary soul repose,
      The wounded spirit heal.

3   When dire temptations gather round
      And threaten or allure,
    By storm or calm, in thee be found
      A refuge strong and sure.

4   When age advances, may we grow
      In faith, in hope, and love,
    And walk in holiness below
      To holiness above.

5   When earthly joys and cares depart,
      Desire and envy cease,
    Be thou the portion of our heart,--
      In thee may we have peace.

The Solace of Faith.


1   When human hopes and joys depart,
    I give thee, Lord, a contrite heart;
    And on my weary spirit steal
    The thoughts that pass all earthly weal.

2   I cast above my tearful eyes,
    And muse upon the starry skies;
    And think that He who governs there
    Still keeps me in his guardian care.

3   I gaze upon the opening flower,
    Just moistened with the evening shower;
    And bless the love which made it bloom,
    To chase away my transient gloom.

4   I think, whene'er this mortal frame
    Returns again to whence it came,
    My soul shall wing its happy flight
    To regions of eternal light.

2   O for a humble, contrite heart,
      Believing, true, and clean,
    Which neither life nor death can part
      From him who dwells within;--

3   A heart in every thought renewed,
      And full of love divine,
    Perfect, and right, and pure and good,
      Conformed, O Lord, to thine.

4   Thy temper, gracious Lord, impart;

    O, write thy name upon my heart,
      Thy name, O God, is Love.

2   Thy voice we hear, thy presence feel,
      Whilst thou, too pure for mortal sight,
    Involved in clouds, invisible,
      Reignest the Lord of life and light.

3   We know not in what hallowed part
      Of the wide heavens thy throne may be;
    But this we know,--that where thou art,
      Strength, wisdom, goodness, dwell with thee.

4   Thy children shall not faint nor fear,
      Sustained by this delightful thought,--
    Since thou, their God, art everywhere,

2   O send thy Spirit down to write
      Thy law upon my heart!
    Nor let my tongue indulge deceit,
      Nor act the liar's part.

3   Order my footsteps by thy word,
      And make my heart sincere;
    Let sin have no dominion, Lord,
      But keep my conscience clear.

4   Make me to walk in thy commands,--
      'Tis a delightful road;
    Nor let my head, or heart, or hands,
      Offend against my God.

A Rest Remaineth.

2   A rest where all our souls desire
      Is fixed on things above;
    Where fear, and sin, and grief expire,
      Cast out by perfect love.

3   O that we now that rest might know,
      Believe and enter in!
    Thou Holiest! now the power bestow,

      This unbelief remove:
    The rest of perfect faith impart,
      The sabbath of thy love.

Angels from Heaven Strengthening Him.


1   Lord! in thy garden agony,
      No light seemed on thy soul to break,
    No form of seraph lingered nigh,
      Nor yet the voice of comfort spake;

2   Till, by thine own triumphant word,
      The victory over, ill was won;
    Till the sweet, mournful cry was heard,
      "Thy will, O God, not mine, be done!"

3   Lord, bring these precious moments back,
      When, fainting, against sin we strain;
    Or in thy counsels fail to track
      Aught but the present grief and pain.

4   In weakness, help us to contend;
      In darkness, yield to God our will;
    And true hearts, faithful to the end,
      Cheer by thine holy angels still!

1   And can my heart aspire so high,
      To say, "My Father," God?
    Lord, at thy feet, I fain would lie,
      And learn to kiss the rod.

2   I would submit to all thy will,
      For thou art good and wise;
    Let each rebellious thought be still,
      Nor one faint murmur rise.

3   Thy love can cheer the darkest gloom,
      And bid me wait serene,
    Till hopes and joys immortal bloom,
      And brighten all the scene.

4   "My Father, God," permit my heart
      To plead her humble claim,
    And ask the bliss those words impart,
      In my Redeemer's name.

3   This day be bread and peace my lot:
      All else beneath the sun
    Thou knowest if best bestowed or not
      And let thy will be done.

4   Yet not to earth's contracted span
      Thy goodness let me bound,
    Or think thee Lord alone of man,
      When thousand worlds are round.

5   To thee whose temple is all space,
      Whose altar, earth, sea, skies,
    One chorus let all beings raise,

2   Mean though I am, not wholly so,
      Since quickened by thy breath;
    Lord, lead me wheresoe'er I go,
      Through this day's life or death.

3   Teach me to feel another's woe,
      To hide the fault I see;
    That mercy I to others show,
      That mercy show to me.

4   If I am right, thy grace impart
      Still in the right to stay;
    If I am wrong, O teach my heart
      To find that better way.

5   What conscience dictates to be done,
      Or warns me not to do,
    This teach me more than hell to shun,
      That more than heaven pursue.

      I wait the light above.

5   Thy covenant the last accent claims
      Of this poor faltering tongue;
    And that shall the first notes employ
      Of my celestial song.




487.              L. M.               Henry Moore.

Prayer for Religious Principle.


1   Amidst a world of hopes and fears,
    A wild of cares, and toils, and tears,
    Where foes alarm and dangers threat,
    And pleasures kill, and glories cheat:

2   Shed down, O Lord! a heavenly ray,
    To guide me in the doubtful way;
    And o'er me hold thy shield of power,
    To guard me in the dangerous hour.

3   Teach me the flattering paths to shun,
    In which the thoughtless many run,
    Who for a shade the substance miss,
    And grasp their ruin in their bliss.

4   May never pleasure, wealth or pride,
    Allure my wandering soul aside;
    But through this maze of mortal ill,
    Safe lead me to thy heavenly hill.




488.              L. M.        Christian Psalmist.

Prayer for Divine Help.


1   Be with me, Lord, where'er I go;
    Teach me what thou wouldst have me do;
    Show me my weakness,--let me see
    I have my power, my all from thee.

2   Enrich me always with thy love;
    My kind protection ever prove;
    Thy signet put upon my breast,
    And let thy spirit on me rest.

3   Assist and teach me how to pray;
    Incline my nature to obey;
    What thou abhorr'st that let me flee,
    And only love what pleases thee.

4   O may I never do my will,
    But thine, and only thine, fulfil;
    Let all my time and all my ways
    Be spent and ended to thy praise.

Prayer for the Christian Temper.


1   Almighty Maker! Lord of all!
      Of life the only spring!
    Creator of unnumbered worlds!
      Supreme, Eternal King!

2   Drive from the confines of my heart
      Impenitence and pride;
    Nor let me, in forbidden paths,
      With thoughtless sinners glide.

3   Let not despair nor fell revenge
      Be to my bosom known:
    Oh! give me tears for others' woes,
      And patience for my own.

4   Feed me with necessary food;
      I ask not wealth or fame;
    Give me an eye to see thy will,
      A heart to bless thy name.

5   May still my days serenely pass,
      Without remorse or care;
    And growing holiness my soul
      For life's last hour prepare.




490.              S. M.            Methodist Coll.

For Holiness.


1     The thing my God doth hate
      That I no more may do,
    Thy creature, Lord, again create,
      And all my soul renew;
      Abhor the thing unclean,
    And, sanctified by love divine,
      Forever cease from sin.

2     That blessed law of thine,
      Father, to me impart;
    The Spirit's law of life divine,
      O write it in my heart!
      Implant it deep within,
      Whence it may ne'er remove,
    The law of liberty from sin,
      The perfect law of love.

3     Thy nature be my law,
      Thy spotless sanctity,
    And sweetly every moment draw
      My happy soul to thee.
      Soul of my soul remain!
      Who didst for all fulfil,
    In me, O Lord, fulfil again
      My heavenly Father's will.

"Thy Kingdom Come."


1   Father of me and all mankind,
      And all the hosts above,
    Let every understanding mind
      Unite to praise thy love.

2   Thy kingdom come, with power and grace
      To every heart of man;
    Thy peace, and joy, and righteousness,
      In all our bosoms reign.

3   The righteousness that never ends,
      But makes an end of sin;
    The joy that human thought transcends,
      Into our souls bring in.

4   The kingdom of established peace,
      Which can no more remove;
    The perfect powers of godliness,
      Th' omnipotence of love.




492.              S. M.                     Watts.

Seeking God.


1     My God, permit my tongue
      This joy, to call thee mine;
    And let my early cries prevail
      To taste thy love divine.

2     My thirsty, fainting soul
      Thy mercy does implore;
    Not travellers in desert lands
      Can pant for water more.

3     For life, without thy love,
      No relish can afford;
    No joy can be compared to this,
      To serve and please the Lord.

4     Since thou hast been my help,
      To thee my spirit flies,
    And on thy watchful providence
      My cheerful hope relies.




493.              L. M.                Montgomery.

"O God, my soul thirsteth for thee."


1   O God! thou art my God alone;
      Early to thee my soul shall cry,
    A pilgrim in a land unknown,
      A thirsty land, whose springs are dry.

2   Yet through this rough and thorny maze,
      I follow hard on thee, my God;
    Thine hand unseen upholds my ways;
      I lean upon thy staff and rod.

3   Thee, in the watches of the night,
      When I remember on my bed,
    Thy presence makes the darkness light;
      Thy guardian wings are round my head.

4   Better than life itself thy love,
      Dearer than all beside to me;
    For whom have I in heaven above,
      Or what on earth, compared with thee?

The Knowledge of God.


1   Shine forth, Eternal Source of light!
      And make thy glories known;
    Fill our enlarged, adoring sight
      With lustre all thine own.

2   Vain are the charms, and faint the rays
      The brightest creatures boast;
    And all their grandeur and their praise
      Is in thy presence lost.

3   To know the Author of our frame
      Is our sublimest skill;
    True science is to read thy name,
      True life to obey thy will.

4   For this I long, for this I pray,
      And following on pursue,
    Till visions of eternal day
      Fix and complete the view.




495.            L. M. 6l.                 Addison.

God our Shepherd.


1   The Lord my pasture shall prepare,
    And feed me with a shepherd's care;
    His presence shall my wants supply,
    And guard me with a watchful eye;
    My noonday walks he shall attend,
    And all my midnight hours defend.

2   When in the sultry glebe I faint,
    Or on the thirsty mountains pant,
    To fertile vales and dewy meads
    My weary, wandering steps he leads,
    Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,
    Amid the verdant landscape flow.

3   Though in the paths of death I tread,
    With gloomy horrors overspread,
    My steadfast heart shall fear no ill,
    For thou, O Lord, art with me still.
    Thy friendly staff shall give me aid,
    And guide me through the dreadful shade.

4   Though, in a bare and rugged way,
    Through devious, lonely wilds I stray,
    Thy bounty shall my pains beguile,--
    The barren wilderness shall smile,
    With sudden greens and herbage crowned
    And streams shall murmur all around.




496.              S. M. Patrick

The Fatherly Love of God.


1     God, who is just and kind,
      Will those who err instruct,
    And to the paths of righteousness
      Their wandering steps conduct.

2     The humble soul he guides,
      Teaches the meek his way,
    Kindness and truth he shows to all
      Who his just laws obey.

3     Give me the tender heart
      That mixes fear with love,
    And lead me through whatever path
      Thy wisdom shall approve.

4     Oh! ever keep my soul
      From error, shame and guilt;
    Nor suffer the fair hope to fail,
      Which on thy truth is built.




497.              L. M.             J. F. Oberlin.

Clinging to God.


1   O Lord, thy heavenly grace impart,
    And fix my frail, inconstant heart:
    Henceforth my chief desire shall be
    To dedicate myself to thee.

2   Whate'er pursuits my time employ,
    One thought shall fill my soul with joy:
    That silent, secret thought shall be,
    That all my hopes are fixed on thee.

3   Thy glorious eye pervadeth space;
    Thy presence, Lord, fills every place;
    And wheresoe'er my lot may be,
    Still shall my spirit cleave to thee.

4   Renouncing every earthly thing,
    And safe beneath thy spreading wing,
    My sweetest thought henceforth shall be,
    That all I want I find in thee.




498.              C. M.                     Watts.

God our Refuge and Hope.


1   God, my supporter and my hope,
      My help forever near;
    Thine arm of mercy held me up,
      When sinking in despair.

2   Thy counsels, Lord, shall guide my feet
      Through this dark wilderness;
    Thine hand conduct me near thy seat,
      To dwell before thy face.

3   What if the springs of life were broke,
      And flesh and heart should faint?
    God is my soul's eternal rock,
      The strength of every saint.

4   Behold the sinners, that remove
      Far from thy presence, die;
    Not all the idol gods they love
      Can save them when they cry.

5   But to draw near to thee, my God,
      Shall be my sweet employ;
    My tongue shall sound thy works abroad,
      And tell the world my joy.




499.              C. M.                Montgomery.

For Grateful Submission.


1   One prayer I have,--all prayers in one,--
      When I am wholly thine;
    "Thy will, my God, thy will be done,
      And let that will be mine."

2   All-wise, almighty, and all-good,
      In thee I firmly trust;
    Thy ways, unknown or understood,
      Are merciful and just.

3   May I remember that to thee
      Whate'er I have I owe;
    And back in gratitude from me
      May all thy bounties flow.

4   Thy gifts are only then enjoyed,
      When used as talents lent;
    Those talents only well employed,
      When in thy service spent.

5   And though thy wisdom takes away,
      Shall I arraign thy will?
    No, let me bless thy name, and say,
      "The Lord is gracious still."

The Soul Returning to God.


1   Return, my soul, unto thy rest,
      From vain pursuits and maddening cares,
    From lonely woes that wring thy breast,
      The world's allurements, toils and snares.

2   Return unto thy rest, my soul,
      From all the wanderings of thy thought;
    From sickness unto death made whole;
      Safe through a thousand perils brought.

3   Then to thy rest, my soul return,
      From passions every hour at strife;
    Sin's works, and ways, and wages spurn,
      Lay hold upon eternal life.

4   God is thy rest;--with heart inclined
      To keep his word, that word believe;
    Christ is thy rest;--with lowly mind,
      His light and easy yoke receive.




501.              C. M.                     Watts.

Invocation of the Divine Spirit.


1   Come, holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
      With all thy quickening powers,
    Kindle a flame of sacred love
      In these cold hearts of ours.

2   In vain we tune our formal songs,
      In vain we strive to rise;
    Hosannas languish on our tongues,
      And our devotion dies.

3   Dear Lord! and shall we ever live
      At this poor dying rate?
    Our love so faint, so cold to thee,
      And thine to us so great?

4   Come, holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
      With all thy quickening powers,
    Come, shed abroad a Saviour's love,
      And that shall kindle ours.




502.              C. M.                   Beddome.

For Inward Truth.


1   Am I an Israelite indeed.
      Without a false disguise?
    Have I renounced my sins, and left
      My refuges of lies?

2   Say, does my heart unchanged remain,
      Or is it formed anew?
    What is the rule by which I walk,
      The object I pursue?

3   Cause me, O God of truth and grace,
      My real state to know;
    If I am wrong, O set me right!
      If right, preserve me so!




503.              C. M.            Methodist Coll.

Seeking God.


1   Talk with us, Lord, thyself reveal,
      While here o'er earth we rove;
    Speak to our hearts, and let us feel
      The kindling of thy love.

2   With thee conversing, we forget
      All time, and toil, and care;
    Labor is rest, and pain is sweet,
      If thou, my God, art here.

3   Here, then, my God, vouchsafe to stay,
      And bid my heart rejoice;
    My bounding heart shall own thy sway,
      And echo to thy voice.

Not Ashamed of Christ.


1   Jesus! and shall it ever be!
    A mortal man ashamed of thee;
    Ashamed of thee, whom angels praise,
    Whose glories shine through endless days!

2   Ashamed of Jesus! just as soon
    Let midnight be ashamed of noon;
    'Tis midnight with my soul, till he,
    Bright morning star, bid darkness flee.

3   Ashamed of Jesus! yes I may,
    When I've no guilt to wash away,
    No tear to wipe--no good to crave,
    No fears to quell--no soul to save.

4   Till then--nor is my boasting vain--
    Till then, I boast a Saviour slain;
    And oh! may this my glory be,
    That Christ is not ashamed of me.

The Simplicity of Christ.


1   Lord! that I may learn of thee,
    Give me true simplicity;
    Wean my soul, and keep it low,
    Willing thee alone to know.

2   Of my boasted wisdom spoiled,
    Docile, helpless as a child;
    Only seeing in thy light,
    Only walking in thy might.

3   Then infuse the living grace,
    Truthful soul of righteousness;
    Knowledge, love divine, impart,--
    Life eternal to my heart.




506.             7s. M.                    Newton.

Docility and Trust.


1   Quiet, Lord, my froward heart,
      Make me teachable and mild;
    Upright, simple, free from art,
      Make me as a weanéd child;
    From distrust and envy free,
    Pleased with all that pleaseth thee.

2   What thou shalt to-day provide,
      Let me as a child receive;
    What to-morrow may betide,
      Calmly to thy wisdom leave:
    'Tis enough that thou wilt care;
    Why should I the burden bear?

3   As a little child relies
      On a care beyond his own;
    Knows he's neither strong nor wise
      Fears to stir a step alone;
    Let me thus with thee abide,
    As my Father, Guard, and Guide.




507.              L. M.              Beard's Coll.

God's Care our Comfort.


1   Oh! sweet it is to know, to feel,
      In all our gloom, our wanderings here,
    No night of sorrow can conceal
      Man from thy notice, from thy care.

2   When disciplined by long distress,
      And led through paths of fear and woe,
    Say, dost thou love thy children less?
      No! ever-gracious Father, no!

3   No distance can outreach thine eye,
      No night obscure thy endless day:
    Be this my comfort when I sigh,
      Be this my safeguard when I stray.

The Water of Life.


1     The fountain in its source
      No drought of summer fears;
    The farther it pursues its course,
      The nobler it appears.

2     But shallow cisterns yield
      A scanty, short supply;
    The morning sees them amply filled,
      At evening they are dry.

3     The cisterns I forsake,
      O fount of bliss, for thee!
    My thirst with living waters slake,
      And drink eternity.




509.              C. M.             Rippon's Coll.

Peace with God.


1   Father! whate'er of earthly bliss
      Thy sovereign will denies,
    Accepted at thy throne of grace,
      Let this petition rise:--

2   "Give me a calm, a thankful heart,
      From every murmur free;
    The blessings of thy grace impart,
      And make me live to thee.

3   "Let the sweet hope that thou art mine
      My life and death attend;
    Thy presence through my journey shine,
      And crown my journey's end."




510.              S. M.        Christian Psalmist.

The Way of God with the Spirit.


1     'Tis God the spirit leads
      In paths before unknown:
    The work to be performed is ours;
      The strength is all his own.

2     Assisted by his grace,
      We still pursue our way;
    And hope at last to reach the prize,
      Secure in endless day.

3     'Tis he that works to will;
      'Tis he that works to do;
    His is the power by which we act,
      His be the glory too.




511.            L. M. 6l.      Christian Psalmist.

Foretaste of Heaven.


1   What must it be to dwell above,
      At God's right hand, where Jesus reigns,
    Since the sweet earnest of his love
      O'erwhelms us on these earthly plains!
    No heart can think, no tongue explain,
    What bliss it is with Christ to reign.

2   When sin no more obstructs our sight,
      When sorrow pains our hearts no more,
    How shall we view the Prince of Light
      And all his works of grace explore!
    What heights and depths of love divine
    Will there through endless ages shine!

3   This is the heaven I long to know;
      For this, with patience, I would wait,
    Till, weaned from earth, and all below,
      I mount to my celestial seat,
    And wave my palm, and wear my crown,
    And, with the elders, cast them down.




512.              C. M.                 Doddridge.

Jesus precious to them that believe.


1   Jesus, I love thy charming name;
      'Tis music to my ear;
    Fain would I sound it out so loud
      That earth and heaven might hear.

2   Whate'er my noblest powers can wish
      In thee doth richly meet;
    No light unto my eyes so dear,
      No friendship half so sweet.

3   Thy grace shall dwell upon my heart,
      And shed its fragrance there,--
    The noblest balm of all its wounds,
      The cordial of its care.

4   I'll speak the honors of thy name
      With my expiring breath,
    And, dying, clasp thee in my arms,
      The antidote of death.




513.              C. M.                     Watts.

The Hope of Heaven.


1   When I can read my title clear
      To mansions in the skies,
    I bid farewell to every fear,
      And wipe my weeping eyes.

2   Let cares like a wild deluge come,
      And storms of sorrow fall,
    May I but safely reach my home,
      My God, my heaven, my all!

3   There shall I bathe my weary soul
      In seas of heavenly rest,
    And not a wave of trouble roll
      Across my peaceful breast.




LIFE, DEATH AND FUTURITY.

"From everlasting to everlasting, thou art God."


1   Our God, our help in ages past,
      Our hope for years to come,
    Our shelter from the stormy blast,
      And our eternal home;

2   Before the hills in order stood,
      Or earth received her frame,
    From everlasting thou art God,
      To endless years the same.

3   A thousand ages, in thy sight,
      Are like an evening gone;
    Short as the watch that ends the night,
      Before the rising sun.

4   Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
      Bears all its sons away;
    They fly forgotten, as  a dream
      Dies at the opening day.

The Providence of Life.


1   Almighty King! whose wondrous hand
    Supports the weight of sea and land,
    Whose grace is such a boundless store,
    No heart shall break that sighs for more!

2   Thy providence supplies my food,
    And 'tis thy blessing makes it good:
    My soul is nourished by thy word;
    Let soul and body praise the Lord.

3   My streams of outward comfort came
    From him who built this earthly frame;
    Whate'er I want his bounty gives,
    By whom my soul forever lives.

4   Either his hand preserves from pain,
    Or, if I feel it, heals again;
    From strife and sorrow shields my breast,
    Or overrules them for the best.

The Pilgrimage of Life.


1   Lead us with thy gentle sway,
      As a willing child is led;
    Speed us on our forward way,
      As a pilgrim, Lord, is sped,
    Who with prayers and helps divine
    Seeks a consecrated shrine.

2   We are pilgrims, and our goal
      Is that distant land whose bourn
    Is the haven of the soul;
      Where the mourners cease to mourn,
    Where the Saviour's hand will dry
    Every tear from every eye.

3   Lead us thither! thou dost know
      All the way; but wanderers we
    Often miss our path below,
      And stretch out our hands to thee;
    Guide us,--save us,--and prepare
    Our appointed mansion there!

1   While through this changing world we roam,
      From infancy to age,
    Heaven is the Christian pilgrim's home,
      His rest at every stage.

    There his adoring spirit bends,
      While here he kneels in prayer.

3   Oh! there may we our treasure place,
      There let our hearts be found;
    That still, where sin abounded, grace
      May more and more abound.

4   Henceforth our conversation be
      With Christ before the throne;
    Ere long, we eye to eye shall see,
      And know as we are known.

Redeeming the Time.


1   God of eternity! from thee
      Did infant time its being draw;
    Moments and days, and months, and years,
      Revolve by thine unvaried law.

2   Silent and swift they glide away;
      Steady and strong the current flows,
    Lost in eternity's wide sea,
      The boundless gulf from whence it rose.

3   With it the thoughtless sons of men
      Before the rapid stream are borne
    On to their everlasting home,
      Whence not one soul can e'er return.

4   Great Source of wisdom! teach our hearts
      To know the price of every hour,
    That time may bear us on to joys
      Beyond its measure and its power.

What is your Life?


1   O, what is life?--'tis like a flower
      That blossoms and is gone;
    It flourishes its little hour,
      With all its beauty on:
    Death comes, and, like a wintry day,
    It cuts the lovely flower away.

2   O, what is life?--'tis like the bow
      That glistens in the sky:
    We love to see its colors glow;
      But, while we look, they die:
    Life fails as soon:--to-day 'tis here;
    To-morrow it may disappear.

3   Lord, what is life?--if spent with thee
      In humble praise and prayer,
    How long or short our life may be,
      We feel no anxious care:
    Though life depart, our joys shall last
    When life and all its joys are past.

1   Our times are in thy hand, and thou
      Wilt guide our footsteps at thy will:
    Lord, to thy purposes we bow,
      Do thou thy purposes fulfil!

2   Life's mighty waters roll along,
      Thy spirit guides them as they roll;
    And waves on waves impetuous throng
      At thy command, at thy control.

3   Lord, we, thy children, look to thee,
      And with an humble, prostrate will,
    Find in thine all-sufficiency
      A claim to love and serve thee still.

"Why sayest thou--my way is hid from the Lord?"


1     Along my earthly way,
      How many clouds are spread!
    Darkness, with scarce one cheerful ray,
      Seems gathering o'er my head.

2     Yet, Father, thou art love:
      O hide not from my view!
    But when I look, in prayer, above,
      Appear in mercy through!

3     My pathway is not hid;
      Thou knowest all my need;
    And I would do as Israel did,--
      Follow where thou wilt lead.

4     Lead me, and then my feet
      Shall never, never stray;
    But safely I shall reach the seat
      Of happiness and day.

5     And O from that bright throne,
      I shall look back, and see,--
    The path I went, and that alone,
      Was the right path for me.

The Dead speaking to the Living.


1   Rise, O my soul! pursue the path
      By ancient worthies trod;
    Aspiring, view those holy men
      Who lived and walked with God.

2   Though dead, they speak in reason's ear,
      And in example live;
    Their faith, and hope, and mighty deeds,
      Still fresh instruction give.

3   Confiding in his heavenly strength,
      They conquered every foe;
    To his almighty power and grace
      Their crowns of life they owe.

4   Lord, may I ever keep in view
      The patterns thou hast given;
    And never wander from the road
      That led them safe to heaven.

The Pilgrimage of Life.


1   Our country is Immanuel's ground;
      We seek that promised soil;
    The songs of Zion cheer our hearts,
      While strangers here we toil.

2   Oft do our eyes with joy o'erflow,
      And oft are bathed in tears;
    Yet naught but heaven our hopes can raise,
      And naught but sin our fears.

3   We tread the path our Master trod:
      We bear the cross he bore;
    And every thorn that wounds our feet,
      His temples pierced before.

4   Our powers are oft dissolved away
      In ecstasies of love;
    And while our bodies wander here,
      Our souls are fixed above.

5   We purge our mortal dross away,
      Refining as we run;
    But while we die to earth and sense,
      Our heaven is here begun.




524.              C. M.                     Watts.

"We are fearfully and wonderfully made."


1   Let others boast how strong they be,
      Nor death nor danger fear;
    But we'll confess, O Lord, to thee,
      What feeble things we are.

2   Fresh as the grass our bodies stand,
      And flourish bright and gay;
    A blasting wind sweeps o'er the land,
      And fades the grass away.

3   Our life contains a thousand springs,
      And fails if one be gone;
    Strange! that a harp of thousand strings
      Should keep in tune so long.

4   But 'tis our God supports our frame,
      The God who built us first;
    Salvation to the Almighty Name
      That reared us from the dust!

"Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven."


1   These mortal joys, how soon they fade!
      How swift they pass away!
    The dying flower reclines its head,
      The beauty of a day.

2   Soon are those earthly treasures lost,
      We fondly call our own;
    Scarce the possession can we boast,
      When straight we find them gone.

3   But there are joys which cannot die,
      With God laid up in store;
    Treasures beyond the changing sky,
      More bright than golden ore.

4   The seeds which piety and love
      Have scattered here below,
    In the fair, fertile fields above
      To ample harvests grow.

Lightning in the Night.


1   A glance from heaven, with sweet effect,
      Sometimes my pensive spirit cheers:
    But ere I can my thoughts collect,
      As suddenly it disappears.

2   So lightning in the gloom of night
      Affords a momentary day;
    Disclosing objects full in sight,
      Which, soon as seen, are snatched away.

3   The lightning's flash did not create
      The opening prospect it revealed;
    But only showed the real state
      Of what the darkness had concealed.

4   Just so, we by a glimpse discern
      The glorious things within the veil;
    That, when in darkness, we may learn
      To live by faith, till light prevail.

The Changes of Life.


1   The evils that beset our path,
      Who can prevent or cure?
    We stand upon the brink of death
      When most we seem secure.

2   If we to-day sweet peace possess,
      It soon may be withdrawn;
    Some change may plunge us in distress
      Before to-morrow's dawn.

3   Disease and pain invade our health,
      And find an easy prey;
    And oft, when least expected, wealth
      Takes wings and flies away.

4   The gourds from which we look for fruit.
      Produce us often pain;
    A worm unseen attacks the root,
      And all our hopes are vain.

5   Since sin has filled the earth with woe,
      And creatures fade and die;
    Lord, wean our hearts from things below,
      And fix our hopes on high!

"The Fathers, where are they?"


1     How swift the torrent rolls,
      That bears us to the sea!
    The tide that bears our thoughtless souls
      To vast eternity!

2   Our fathers, where are they,
      With all they called their own?
    Their joys, and griefs, and hopes and cares,
      And wealth and honor gone.

3     God of our fathers, hear,
      Thou everlasting Friend!
    While we, as on life's utmost verge,
      Our souls to thee commend.

4     Of all the pious dead
      May we the footsteps trace,
    Till with them, in the land of light,
      We dwell before thy face.

1   My Father! when around me spread
      I see the shadows of the tomb,
    And life's bright visions droop and fade,
      And darkness veils my future doom;

2   O, in that anguished hour I turn
      With a still trusting heart to thee,
    And holy thoughts still shine and burn
      Amid that cold, sad destiny.

3   The stars of heaven are shining on,
      Though these frail eyes are dim with tears;
    The hopes of earth indeed are gone;
      But are not ours the immortal years?

4   Father! forgive the heart that clings
      Thus trembling to the joys of time;
    And bid my soul on angel wings
      Ascend into a purer clime.

    Lo! mortal men by thousands die:
    One glance from thee at once brings down
    The proudest brow that wears a crown.

2   Banished at once from human sight
    To the dark grave's mysterious night,
    Imprisoned in that dusty bed,
    We hide our solitary head.

3   Yet if my Father's faithful hand
    Conduct me through this gloomy land,
    My soul with pleasure shall obey,
    And follow where he leads the way.

4   The friendly band again shall meet,
    Again exchange the welcome sweet;
    The dear familiar features trace,
    And still renew the fond embrace.

Universal Warning of Death.


1   Beneath our feet and o'er our head
      Is equal warning given:
    Beneath us lie the countless dead,
      Above us is the heaven!

2   Their names are graven on the stone,
      Their bones are in the clay;
    And ere another day is done,
      Ourselves may be as they.

3   Our eyes have seen the rosy light
      Of youth's soft cheek decay,
    And fate descend in sudden night
      On manhood's middle day.

4   Our eyes have seen the steps of age
      Halt feebly towards the tomb;
    And yet shall earth our hearts engage,
      And dreams of days to come?

5   Death rides on every passing breeze,
      He lurks in every flower;
    Each season has its own disease,
      Its peril every hour.

2   "He lived,--he died;" behold the sum,

      The infant's day, the patriarch's age.

3   O Father! in whose mighty hand
      The boundless years and ages lie;
    Teach us thy boon of life to prize,
      And use the moments as they fly;

4   To crowd the narrow span of life
      With wise designs and virtuous deeds;
    And bid us wake from death's dark night,
      To share the glory that succeeds.

2   Thou Source of life and joy supreme,
      Whose arm alone can save,
    Dispel the darkness that surrounds
      The entrance to the grave.

3   Lay thy supporting, gentle hand
      Beneath my sinking head,
    And let a beam of light divine
      Illume my dying bed.

Christ's Presence makes Death easy.


1   Why should we start and fear to die!
      What timorous worms we mortals are!
    Death is the gate of endless joy,
      And yet we dread to enter there.

2   The pains, the groans, and dying strife,
      Fright our approaching souls away;
    Still we shrink back again to life,
      Fond of our prison and our clay.

3   O! if my Lord would come and meet,
      My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
    Fly fearless through death's iron gate,
      Nor feel the terrors as she past.

4   Jesus can make a dying bed
      Feel soft as downy pillows are,
    While on his breast I lean my head,
      And breathe my life out sweetly there.

    Thy love, through each revolving year,
    Has wiped away affliction's tear.

2   Free us from death's terrific gloom,
    And all the fear which shrouds the tomb;
    Heighten our joys, support our head,
    Before we sink among the dead.

3   May death conclude our toils and tears!
    May death destroy our sins and fears!
    May death, through Jesus, be our friend!
    May death be life, when life shall end!

4   Crown our last moment with thy power--
    The latest in our latest hour;
    Till to the raptured heights we soar,
    Where fears and death are known no more.

2   Soon will the storms of life be o'er,
      And I shall enter endless rest:
    There I shall live to sin no more,
      And bless thy name forever blest.

    And yet the Sun of Righteousness
      Shall rise amidst the gloom,

      The shadows of the tomb.

3   Thou must go forth alone, my soul!

1   Behold the path which mortals tread,
    Down to the regions of the dead!
    Nor will the fleeting moments stay,
    Nor can we measure back our day.

2   Our kindred and our friends are gone;
    Know, O my soul! this doom my own;
    Feeble as theirs my mortal frame,
    The same my way, my home the same.

3   Awake, my soul, thy way prepare,
    And lose in this each mortal care;
    With steady feet that path be trod,
    Which, through the grave, conducts to God.

4   Father! to thee my all I trust;
    And if thou call me down to dust,
    I know thy voice, I bless thy hand,
    And die in peace at thy command.

    And let me languish into life!

    What is this absorbs me quite,
    Steals my senses, shuts my sight,
    Drowns my spirits, draws my breath?
    Tell me, my soul, can this be death?

3   The world recedes!--it disappears!
    Heaven opens on my eyes!--my ears

1   Sweet is the scene when virtue dies!
      When sinks a righteous soul to rest;
    How mildly beam the closing eyes,
      How gently heaves th' expiring breast!

2   So fades a summer cloud away,
      So sinks the gale when storms are o'er,
    So gently shuts the eye of day,
      So dies a wave along the shore.

3   Farewell, conflicting hopes and fears,
      Where lights and shades alternate dwell;
    How bright th' unchanging morn appears!
      Farewell, inconstant world, farewell!

4   Life's duty done, as sinks the clay,
      Light from its load the spirit flies;
    While heaven and earth combine to say,
      "How blessed the righteous when he dies!"

      It melts in deeper gloom;
    So calm the righteous sink away,
      Descending to the tomb.
    The winds breathe low--the yellow leaf
      Scarce whispers from the tree!
    So gently flows the parting breath,
      When good men cease to be.

2   How beautiful, on all the hills,
      The crimson light is shed!
    'Tis like the peace the dying gives
      To mourners round his bed.
    How mildly on the wandering cloud
      The sunset beam is cast!
    So sweet the memory left behind,
      When loved ones breathe their last.

3   And lo! above the dews of night
      The vesper star appears!
    So faith lights up the mourner's heart,
      Whose eyes are dim with tears.
    Night falls, but soon the morning light
      Its glories shall restore;
    And thus the eyes that sleep in death
      Shall wake, to close no more.

      Take this new treasure to thy trust,
    And give these sacred relics room
      To seek a slumber in thy dust.

2   Nor pain, nor grief, nor anxious fear,
      Invade thy bounds; no mortal woes
    Can reach the peaceful sleeper here,
      While angels watch the soft repose.

3   So Jesus slept; God's dying Son
      Passed through the grave, and blessed the bed;
    Then rest, dear saint, till from his throne
      The morning break, and pierce the shade.

4   Break from his throne, illustrious morn!
      Attend, O earth, his sovereign word!
    Restore thy trust! the glorious form
      Shall then arise to meet the Lord.

1   Hear what the voice from heaven proclaims,
      For all the pious dead;
    Sweet is the savor of their names,
      And soft their sleeping bed.

2   They die in Jesus, and are blessed;
      How kind their slumbers are!
    From sufferings and from sin released,
      And freed from every snare.

3   Far from this world of toil and strife,
      They're present with the Lord!
    The labors of their mortal life
      End in a large reward.

1   Hark! a voice divides the sky!
      Happy are the faithful dead,
    In the Lord who sweetly die!
      They from all their toils are freed.

2   Ready for their glorious crown,--
      Sorrows past and sins forgiven,--
    Here they lay their burthen down,
      Hallowed and made meet for heaven.

3   Yes! the Christian's course is run;
      Ended is the glorious strife;
    Fought the fight, the work is done;
      Death is swallowed up in life.

4   When from flesh the spirit freed
      Hastens homeward to return,
    Mortals cry, "A man is dead!"
      Angels sing, "A child is born!"

"Asleep in Christ."


1   Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep!
    From which none ever wakes to weep;
    A calm and undisturbed repose,
    Unbroken by the dread of foes.

2   Asleep in Jesus! peaceful rest!
    Whose waking is supremely blest;
    No fear, no woes shall dim that hour,
    Which manifests the Saviour's power!

3   Asleep in Jesus! time nor space
    Debars this precious hiding place;
    On Indian plains, or Lapland's snows,
    Believers find the same repose.

4   Asleep in Jesus! far from thee
    Thy kindred and their graves may be;
    But thine is still a blesséd sleep,
    From which none ever wakes to weep.

The Resurrection.


1   All nature dies and lives again:
      The flowers that paint the field,
    The trees that crown the mountain's brow,
      And boughs and blossoms yield,--
    Resign the honors of their form
      At winter's stormy blast,
    And leave the naked, leafless plain
      A desolated waste.

2   Yet, soon reviving, plants and flowers
      Anew shall deck the plain;
    The woods shall hear the voice of spring,
      And flourish green again.
    So, to the dreary grave consigned,
      Man sleeps in death's dark gloom,
    Until th' eternal morning wake
      The slumbers of the tomb.

3   O may the grave become to me
      The bed of peaceful rest,
    Whence I shall gladly rise at length,
      And mingle with the blessed!
    Cheered by this hope, with patient mind
      I'll wait Heaven's high decree,
    Till the appointed period come
      When death shall set me free.

The Changes of Nature Types of Immortality.


1   As twilight's gradual veil is spread
      Across the evening sky;
    So man's bright hours decline in shade,
      And mortal comforts die.

2   The bloom of spring, the summer rose,
      In vain pale winter brave;
    Nor youth, nor age, nor wisdom knows
      A ransom from the grave.

3   But morning dawns and spring revives,
      And genial hours return;
    So man's immortal soul survives,
      And scorns the mouldering urn.

4   When this vain scene no longer charms,
      Or swiftly fades away,
    He sinks into a Father's arms,
      Nor dreads the coming day.

Resurrection of Christ.


1       Lift your glad voices in triumph on high,
        For Jesus hath risen, and man cannot die:
    Vain were the terrors that gathered around him,
      And short the dominion of death and the grave;
    He burst from the fetters of darkness that bound him
      Resplendent in glory, to live and to save:
        Loud was the chorus of angels on high,--
        The Saviour hath risen, and man shall not die.

2       Glory to God in full anthems of joy,
        The being he gave us death cannot destroy:
    Sad were the life we must part with to-morrow,
      If tears were our birthright, and death were our end;
    But Jesus hath cheered the dark valley of sorrow,
      And bade us, immortal, to heaven ascend:
        Lift, then, your voices in triumph on high,
        For Jesus hath risen, and man shall not die.

    Fought the fight, the battle won;
    Lo our Sun's eclipse is o'er;
    Lo! he sets in blood no more.

3   Vain the stone, the watch, the seal;
    Christ hath burst the gates of hell;
    Death in vain forbids his rise;
    Christ hath opened paradise.

4   Soar we now where Christ hath led,
    Following our exalted Head:
    Made like him, like him we rise;
    Ours the cross, the grave, the skies.

Nature Transitory--the Soul Immortal.


1   See lovely nature raise her head,
      In various graces dressed;
    Her lucid robe by ocean spread,
      Her verdant, flowery vest.

2   How glorious are those orbs of light,
      In all their bright array,
    That gem the ebon brow of night,
      Or pour the blaze of day!

3   One gem of purest ray, divine,
      Alone disclaims her power;
    Still brighter shall its glories shine,
      When hers are seen no more.

4   Her pageants pass, nor leave a trace
      The soul no change shall fear;
    The God of nature and of grace
      Has stamped his image there.

A Prospect of Heaven.


1   There is a land of pure delight,
      Where saints immortal reign;
    Eternal day excludes the night,
      And pleasures banish pain.

2   There everlasting spring abides,
      And never-withering flowers:
    Death, like a narrow sea, divides
      This heavenly land from ours.

3   Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood
      Stand dressed in living green:
    So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
      And Jordan rolled between.

4   O could we make our doubts remove,--
      Those gloomy doubts that rise,--
    And see the Canaan that we love
      With unbeclouded eyes.

5   Could we but climb where Moses stood,
      And view the landscape o'er,--
    Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,
      Should fright us from the shore.

      Dawned on our early days,
    Ere infant reason had begun
      To form our lips to praise.

3     But we expect a day
      Still brighter far than this,
    When death shall bear our souls away
      To realms of light and bliss.

4     Nor shall that radiant day,
      So joyfully begun,
    In evening shadows die away

2   There is a home for weary souls,
      By sins and sorrows driven,
    When tossed on life's tempestuous shoals,
    Where storms arise, and ocean rolls,
      And all is drear--'tis heaven.

3   There faith lifts up the tearless eye,
      The heart no longer riven,--
    And views the tempest passing by,
    Sees evening shadows quickly fly,
      And all serene in heaven.

4   There fragrant flowers immortal bloom,

      Appears the dawn of heaven.

      And pearly gates behold?
    Thy bulwarks with salvation strong,
      And streets of shining gold.

2   There happier bowers than Eden's bloom,
      Nor sin nor sorrow know:
    Blest seats! through rude and stormy scenes
      I onward press to you.
    Why should I shrink at pain and woe?
      Or feel at death dismay?
    I've Canaan's goodly land in view,
      And realms of endless day.

3   Apostles, martyrs, prophets, there,
      Around my Saviour stand;
    And soon my friends in Christ below
      Will join the glorious band.

    Then shall my labors have an end,
      When I thy joys shall see.

      One half its blessedness unfold.

      The land of glory and repose;
    And there, to dim the radiant scene,
      No tear of sorrow ever flows.

4   It is not fanned by summer gale;
      'Tis not refreshed by vernal showers;
    It never needs the moon-beam pale,
      For there are known no evening hours.

    Are walking with their God on high,

    There those who meet shall part no more,
      And those long parted meet again.

    Dims its unsullied blessedness.

      Whose days a peaceful tenor keep;
    The God, who loves our race, has shown
      A blessing for the eyes that weep.

2   The light of smiles shall fill again
      The lids that overflow with tears,
    And weary hours of woe and pain
      Are earnests of serener years.

3   O, there are days of sunny rest
      For every dark and troubled night!
    Grief may abide, an evening guest,
      But joy shall come with early light.

4   And thou, who o'er thy friend's low bier
      Sheddest the bitter drops like rain,
    Hope that a brighter, happier sphere
      Will give him to thy arms again.

5   For God hath marked each anguished day,

      Though sorrows and darkness encompass the tomb;
    The Saviour has passed through its portals before thee;
      And the lamp of his love is thy guide through the gloom.

2   Thou art gone to the grave; we no longer behold thee,
      Nor tread the rough paths of the world by thy side:
    But the wide arms of mercy are spread to enfold thee,
      And sinners may hope, since the Saviour hath died.

3   Thou art gone to the grave; and, its mansion forsaking,
      Perchance thy weak spirit in doubt lingered long;
    But the sunshine of heaven beamed bright on thy waking,
      And the sound thou didst hear was the seraphim's song.

4   Thou art gone to the grave; but we will not deplore thee;
      Since God was thy Refuge, thy Guardian, thy Guide;
    He gave thee, he took thee, and he will restore thee;
      And death has no sting, since the Saviour hath died.

2   O, might some dream of visioned bliss,
      Some trance of rapture, show
    Where, on the bosom of their God,
      They rest from human woe!

3   Thence may their pure devotion's flame
      On us, on us descend;
    To us their strong aspiring hopes,
      Their faith, their fervors lend.

    To welcome all that's left of good,

      Pass like an evening meteor's flight!
    Not dark with guilt, nor dim with tears;
      Whose course is short, unclouded, bright.

3   O, cheerless were our lengthened way;
      But Heaven's own light dispels the gloom,
    Streams downward from eternal day,
      And casts a glory round the tomb.

4   O, stay thy tears: the blest above
      Have hailed a spirit's heavenly birth,
    And sung a song of joy and love;
      Then why should anguish reign on earth?

      O'erwearied and unblest,
    A host of restless phantoms chase;--
      Why mourn for those who rest?

2     We mourn for those who sin?
      Bound in the tempter's snare,
    Whom syren pleasure beckons in
      To prisons of despair;
      Whose hearts, by passions torn,
      Are wrecked on folly's shore;--
    But why in sorrow should we mourn
      For those who sin no more?

3     We mourn for those who weep;
      Whom stern afflictions bend
    With anguish o'er the lowly sleep
      Of lover or of friend:

      Of pain and grief is o'er,
    Whose tears our God hath wiped away,
      O mourn for them no more!

      Who've fled and left thee mourning here?
    Triumphant o'er their latest foe,
      They glory in a brighter sphere.

2   Weep not for them;--beside thee now
      Perhaps they watch with guardian care,
    And witness tears that idly flow
      O'er those who bliss of angels share.

3   Or round their Father's throne, above,
      With raptured voice his praise they sing;
    Or on his messages of love,
      They journey with unwearied wing.

4   Weep, weep no more; their voices raise
      The song of triumph high to God;
    And wouldst thou join their song of praise,
      Walk humbly in the path they trod.

Friends die, but to live again.


1     Friend after friend departs;
      Who hath not lost a friend?
    There is no union here of hearts,
      That finds not here an end.
    Were this frail world our only rest,
    Living or dying, none were blest.

2     There is a world above,
      Where parting is unknown,--
    A whole eternity of love
      And blessedness alone;
    And faith beholds the dying here,
    Translated to that happier sphere.

3     Thus, star by star declines
      Till all are passed away,
    As morning high and higher shines
      To pure and perfect day.
    Nor sink those stars in empty night--
    They hide themselves in heaven's own light.

      Or shake at death's alarms?
    'Tis but the voice that Jesus sends
      To call them to his arms.

2   Why should we tremble to convey
      Their bodies to the tomb?
    There the dear flesh of Jesus lay,
      And left a long perfume.

3   The graves of all his saints he blest,
      And softened every bed:
    Where should the dying members rest,
      But with their dying Head?

Invitation to the Mercy-seat.


1   Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish;
      Come, at the mercy-seat fervently kneel:
    Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
      Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.

2   Joy of the desolate, light of the straying,
      Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure,
    Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,
      Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.

The Christian's Burial.


1   Brother, though from yonder sky
    Cometh neither voice nor cry,
    Yet we know for thee to-day
    Every pain hath passed away.

2   Not for thee shall tears be given,
    Child of God and heir of heaven;
    For he gave thee sweet release;
    Thine the Christian's death of peace.

3   Well we know thy living faith
    Had the power to conquer death;
    As a living rose may bloom
    By the border of the tomb.

4   While we weep as Jesus wept,
    Thou shall sleep as Jesus slept:
    With thy Saviour thou shalt rest,
    Crowned, and glorified and blest.

Peaceful Death of the Righteous.


1   I looked upon the righteous man,
      And saw his parting breath,
    Without a struggle or a sigh,
      Serenely yield to death:
    There was no anguish on his brow,
      Nor terror in his eye;
    The spoiler aimed a fatal dart,
      But lost the victory.

2   I looked upon the righteous man,
      And heard the holy prayer
    Which rose above that breathless form,
      To soothe the mourners' care,
    And felt how precious was the gift
      He to his loved ones gave,--
    The stainless memory of the just,
      The wealth beyond the grave.

3   I looked upon the righteous man;
      And all our earthly trust
    Of pleasure, vanity, or pride,
      Seemed lighter than the dust,
    Compared with his celestial gain,--
      A home above the sky:
    O, grant us, Lord, his life to live,
      That we like him may die.

At a Funeral.


1   Farewell! what power of words can tell
    The sorrows of a last farewell,
    When, standing by the mournful bier,
    We mingle with our prayers a tear!

2   When memory tells of days gone by,
    Of blighted hope and vanished joy:
    Bright hopes that withered like a flower,
    Cut down and faded in an hour.

3   Give forth thy chime, thou solemn bell,
    Thou grave, unfold thy marble cell;
    Oh earth! receive upon thy breast
    The weary trav'ller to his rest.

4   Oh God, extend thy arms of love,
    A spirit seeketh thee above!
    Ye heav'nly palaces unclose,
    Receive the weary to repose!

Burial of a Friend.


1   As, bowed by sudden storms, the rose
      Sinks on the garden's breast,
    Down to the grave our brother goes,
      In silence there to rest.

2   No more with us his tuneful voice
      The hymn of praise shall swell;
    No more his cheerful heart rejoice
      When peals the Sabbath bell.

3   Yet, if, in yonder cloudless sphere
      Amid a sinless throng,
    He utters in his Saviour's ear
      The everlasting song,--

4   No more we'll mourn the absent friend,
      But lift our earnest prayer,
    And daily every effort bend
      To rise and join him there.

The Re-union of Friends after Death.


1   Blest be the hour when friends shall meet,
      Shall meet to part no more,
    And with celestial welcome greet,
      On an immortal shore.

2   Sweet hope, deep cherished, not in vain,
      Now art thou richly crowned!
    All that was dead revives again;
      All that was lost is found!

3   The parent eyes his long-lost child;
      Brothers on brothers gaze:
    The tear of resignation mild
      Is changed to joy and praise.

4   And while remembrance, lingering still,
      Draws joy from sorrowing hours;
    New prospects rise, new pleasures fill
      The soul's capacious powers.

5   Their Father fans their generous flame,
      And looks complacent down;
    The smile that owns their filial claim
      Is their immortal crown.

"Not lost, but gone before."

      Who safe arrive on Canaan's shore?
    Released from all their hurtful foes,
      They are not lost--but gone before.

2   How many painful days on earth
      Their fainting spirits numbered o'er!
    Now they enjoy a heavenly birth;
      They are not lost--but gone before.

3   Dear is the spot where Christians sleep,
      And sweet the strain which angels pour;
    O why should we in anguish weep?
      They are not lost--but gone before.

Death of an Infant.


1   As the sweet flower that scents the morn,
      But withers in the rising day,
    Thus lovely was this infant's dawn,
      Thus swiftly fled its life away.

2   It died ere its expanding soul
      Had ever burnt with wrong desires,
    Had ever spurned at Heaven's control,
      Or ever quenched its sacred fires.

3   Yet the sad hour that took the boy
      Perhaps has spared a heavier doom,--
    Snatched him from scenes of guilty joy,
      Or from the pangs of ills to come.

4   He died to sin; he died to care;
      But for a moment felt the rod;
    Then, rising on the viewless air,
      Spread his light wings, and soared to God.

    So soon our transient comforts fly,
    And pleasure only blooms to die.

2   Is there no kind, no healing art,
    To soothe the anguish of the heart?
    Spirit of grace, be ever nigh:
    Thy comforts are not made to die.

3   Let gentle patience smile on pain,
    Till dying hope revives again;
    Hope wipes the tear from sorrow's eye,
    And faith points upward to the sky.

1   Life is a span,--a fleeting hour:
      How soon the vapor flies!
    Man is a tender, transient flower,
      That e'en in blooming dies.

2   The once-loved form, now cold and dead,
      Each mournful thought employs;
    And nature weeps, her comforts fled,
      And withered all her joys.

3   Hope looks beyond the bounds of time,
      When what we now deplore
    Shall rise in full, immortal prime,
      And bloom to fade no more.

4   Cease, then, fond nature, cease thy tears;
      Thy Saviour dwells on high;
    There everlasting spring appears;
      There joy shall never die.

      Fair children of the earth,
    Linked in bright bands celestial,
      Sing of their human birth.

2   They sing of earth and heaven,--
      Divinest voices rise
    To God, their gracious Father,
      Who called them to the skies:

      Safe, safe, and sweetly blest;
    No cloud of sin can shadow
      Their bright and holy rest.

    It murmurs o'er a lovelier bed,

      Lie mute with plumage dim;
    In heaven I see her glancing bright,
      I hear her angel hymn.

3     True that our beauteous doe
      Hath left her still retreat,
    But purer now in heavenly snow,
      She lies at Jesus' feet.

    Spirit to immortal birth;"

    Angels nurture now the child!

2   Upward soaring, like the dove,
    Bearing with her chains of love;
    Not to draw her spirit back,
    But to smooth her upward track:
    Her, the youngest of thy fold,
    Angels watch with love untold!

3   With the Rock of Ages trust,
    That which was enshrined in dust;
    Robed in ever-spotless white,
    In an atmosphere of light,
    By the never-failing springs
    Rests she now her weary wings.

      How vacant it appears!

      For the people of the Lord.

    He who graciously approved thee,--
      Waits thy crown of joy to give.

      With the tones of earthly love,
    Triumph high and joy unending

    Come from the heat of battle and in peace,
      Soldier, go home; with thee the fight is won.

3   Go to the grave, for there thy Saviour lay
      In death's embraces, ere he rose on high;
    And all the ransomed, by that narrow way,
      Pass to eternal life beyond the sky.

4   Go to the grave:--no, take thy seat above;
      Be thy pure spirit present with the Lord,
    Where thou for faith and hope hast perfect love,

1     Servant of God, well done!
      Rest from thy loved employ:
    The battle fought, the victory won,
      Enter thy Master's joy.
      The voice at midnight came,
      He started up to hear;
    A mortal arrow pierced his frame--
      He fell, but felt no fear.

2     Tranquil amidst alarms,
      It found him on the field,
    A veteran slumbering on his arms,
      Beneath his red-cross shield
      His spirit, with a bound,
      Burst its encumbering clay;
    His tent, at sunrise, on the ground,
      A darkened ruin lay.

3     The pains of death are past,
      Labor and sorrow cease,
    And, life's long warfare closed at last,
      His soul is found in peace.
      Soldier of Christ! well done!
      Praise be thy new employ;
    And while eternal ages run,
      Rest in thy Saviour's joy.

      The hope of glory shone;

2   The loving ones we loved the best,
      Like music all are gone;
    And the wan moonlight bathes in rest,
      Their monumental stone.

3   But not when the death-prayer is said,
      The life of life departs:
    The body in the grave is laid,
      Its beauty in our hearts.

4   This frame, O God, this feeble breath,
      Thy hand may soon destroy;
    We think of thee, and feel in death
      A deep and awful joy.

5   Dim is the light of vanished years
      In glory yet to come;
    O idle grief! O foolish tears!
      When Jesus calls us home.

The Peaceful Death of the Righteous.


1     O, for the death of those
      Who slumber in the Lord!
    O, be like theirs my last repose,
      Like theirs my last reward!

2     Their ransomed spirits soar,
      On wings of faith and love,
    To meet the Saviour they adore,
      And reign with him above.

3     With us their names shall live
      Through long-succeeding years,
    Embalmed with all our hearts can give,--
      Our praises and our tears.

"And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre."


1   The mourners came at break of day
      Unto the garden-sepulchre;
    With darkened hearts to weep and pray,
      For him, the loved one buried there.
    What radiant light dispels the gloom?
    An angel sits beside the tomb.

2   Then mourn we not beloved dead,
      E'en while we come to weep and pray;
    The happy spirit far hath fled.
      To brighter realms of endless day;
    Immortal hope dispels the gloom!
    An angel sits beside the tomb.

"Trust ye in the Lord."


1   When grief and anguish press me down,
      And hope and comfort flee,
    I cling, O Father, to thy throne,
      And stay my heart on thee.

2   When clouds of dark temptation rise,
      And pour their wrath on me,
    To thee for aid I turn my eyes,
      And fix my trust on thee.

3   When death invades my peaceful home,
      The sundered ties shall be
    A closer bond in time to come,
      To bind my heart to thee.

4   Lord,--"Not my will but thine be done!"
      My soul from fear set free,
    Her faith shall anchor at thy throne,
      And trust alone in thee.

Weeping Seed-Time and Joyful Harvest.  Ps. 126.


1   The darkened sky, how thick it lowers!
    Troubled with storms, and big with showers,
    No cheerful gleam of light appears,
    And nature pours forth all her tears.

2   But seeds of ecstasy unknown
    Are in these watered furrows sown:
    See the green blades, how thick they rise,
    And with fresh verdure bless our eyes!

3   In secret foldings they contain
    Unnumbered ears of golden grain:
    And heaven shall pour its beams around,
    Till the ripe harvest load the ground.

4   Then shall the trembling mourner come
    And bind his sheaves and bear them home;
    The voice long broke with sighs shall sing,
    Till heaven with hallelujahs ring.

    And, sore dismayed, my spirit dies;
    Yet he who once vouchsafed to bear
    The sick'ning anguish of despair,
    Shall sweetly soothe, shall gently dry,
    The throbbing heart, the streaming eye.

2   When, mourning, o'er some stone I bend,
    Which covers all that was a friend,
    And from his voice, his hand, his smile,
    Divides me for a little while;
    Thou, Saviour, mark'st the tears I shed,
    For thou didst weep o'er Lazarus dead.

3   And oh, when I have safely past
    Through every conflict but the last,
    Still, still unchanging, watch beside
    My painful bed--for thou hast died;
    Then point to realms of cloudless day,
    And wipe the latest tear away.

God, the Refuge of the Afflicted.


1   Affliction is a stormy deep,
      Where wave resounds to wave;
    Though o'er our heads the billows roll,
      We know the Lord can save.

2   When darkness and when sorrows rose,
      And pressed on every side,
    The Lord hath still sustained our steps,
      And still hath been our Guide.

3   Perhaps, before the morning dawn,
      He will restore our peace;
    For he who bade the tempest roar,
      Can bid the tempest cease.

4   Here will we rest, here build our hopes,
      Nor murmur at his rod;
    He's more to us than all the world,
      Our Health, our Life, our God.

      To bear aloft my sinking soul,
    When sorrow o'er my pathway here
      In widely whelming waves doth roll.
    O, teach mine else unguarded heart,
      The clouds of gloomy doubt to shun,
    To bow unto thy chastening hand,
      And meekly say "Thy will be done."

2   Though dark to us thy ways may seem,
      Thy needful chastisements severe;
    Thou dost not willingly afflict,
      Nor grieve thy erring children here.
    O, teach my heart to lean on thee,
      To faith and resignation won,
    To see thy love in all its ways,
      And humbly say, "Thy will be done."

Holy Contentment.


1   Lord, my times are in thy hand:
      All my fondest hopes have planned
    To thy wisdom I resign,
      And would make thy purpose mine.

2   Thou my daily task shalt give;
      Day by day to thee I live:
    So shall added years fulfil
      Not my own, my Father's will.

3   Fond ambition, whisper not;
      Happy is my humble lot:
    Anxious, busy cares, away;
      I'm provided for to-day.

4   O, to live exempt from care,
      By the energy of prayer,
    Strong in faith, with mind subdued,
      Yet elate with gratitude!

Invocation of our Father's Presence.


1   O Father,--draw us after thee!
      So shall we run and never tire;
    Thy presence still our comfort be,
      Our hope, our joy, our sole desire;
    Thy Spirit grant;--for neither fear
    Nor sin can come, while that is here.

2   From all eternity, with love
      Unchangeable, thou hast us viewed;
    Before these beating hearts did move,
      Thy tender mercies us pursued:
    Ever with us may they abide,
    And close us in on every side.

3   In suffering be thy love our peace;
      In weakness be thy love our power;
    And when the storms of life shall cease,
      O God! in that important hour,
    In death as life be thou our guide,
    And bear us through death's whelming tide.

    I'll sing the honors of thy name;
      And spread thy praise abroad.

2   In every period of my life,
      Thy thoughts of love appear;
    Thy mercies gild each transient scene,
      And crown each lengthening year.

3   In all these mercies may my soul
      A father's bounty see:
    Nor let the gifts thy grace bestows
      Estrange my heart from thee.

4   Then will I close my eyes in death,
      Free from distressing fear;
    For death itself is life, my God,
      If thou art with me there.

1   'Tis my happiness below
      Not to live without the cross,
    But the Saviour's power to know,
      Sanctifying every loss:
    Trials must and will befall;
      But with humble faith to see
    Love inscribed upon them all,--
      This is happiness to me.

2   God in Israel sows the seeds
      Of affliction, pain and toil:
    These spring up and choke the weeds
      Which would else o'erspread the soil:
    Trials make the promise sweet;
      Trials give new life to prayer;
    Trials bring me to his feet,
      Lay me low, and keep me there.

1   When called, O Lord, to mourn the doom
      Of one affection held most dear,--
    While o'er the closing, silent tomb,
      The bleeding heart distils the tear,--
    Though love its tribute sure will pay,
      And early streams of solace shun,
    Still, still the humble soul would say,
      In lowly dust, "Thy will be done."

2   Whate'er, O Lord, thou hast designed
      To bring my soul to thee in trust,
    If miseries or afflictions kind,--
      For all thy dealings, Lord, are just,--
    Take all, but grant, in goodness free,
      That love which ne'er thy stroke should shun;
    Support this heart and strengthen me
      To say in faith, "Thy will be done."

      Before thine eye appear.

3   Each golden hour of beaming light
      Is gilded by thy rays;
    And dark affliction's midnight gloom
      A present God surveys.

4   Full in thy view through life I pass,
      And in thy view I die;
    And when each mortal bond is broke,
      Shall find my God is nigh.

      Whose love forbids my fears?
    Or tremble at thy gracious hand
      That wipes away my tears?

3   No! let me rather freely yield
      What most I prize, to thee;
    Who never hast a good withheld,
      Or wilt withhold from me.

2   Thy mercy bids all nature bloom;
      The sun shines bright, and man is gay;
    Thine equal mercy spreads the gloom,
      That darkens o'er his little day.

3   Full many a throb of grief and pain
      Thy frail and erring child must know:
    But not one prayer is breathed in vain,
      Nor does one tear unheeded flow.

      Thy purposes of love fulfil;
    And 'mid the wreck of human joy,
      Let kneeling faith adore thy will.

3   Should friends and kindred, near and dear,
      Leave me to want, or die,
    My God will make my life his care,
      And all my need supply.

2   Thou my Deliverer art, my God;
      My trust is in thy mighty power;
    Thou art my shield from foes abroad,
      At home my safeguard and my tower.

3   To heaven I made my mournful prayer,
      To God addressed my humble moan,
    Who graciously inclined his ear,
      And heard me from his lofty throne.

4   Who, then, deserves to be adored,
      But God, on whom my hopes depend?
    Or who, except the mighty Lord,
      Can with resistless power defend?

Contentment and Resignation.


1   If solid happiness we prize,
    Within our breasts the jewel lies;
      Nor need we roam abroad:
    The world has little to bestow;
    From pious hearts our joys must flow,
      Hearts that delight in God.

2   To be resigned, when ills betide,
    Patient, when favors are denied,
      And pleased with favors given;
    This is the wise, the virtuous part;
    This is that incense of the heart,
      Whose fragrance reaches heaven.

3   Thus through life's changing scenes we'll go,
    Its checkered paths of joy and woe,
      With holy care we'll tread:
    Quit its vain scenes without a tear,
    Without a trouble or a fear,
      And mingle with the dead.

      No joys on earth can find,--
    Then lift thy voice to God on high,
      Dry up the trembling tear,
    And hush the low complaining sigh:
      Fear not; thy God is near.

2   When dark temptations spread their snares
      And earth with charms allures,
    And when thy soul, oppressed with fears,
      The world's assault endures,
    Then let thy Father's friendly voice
      Thy fainting spirit cheer,
    And bid thy trembling heart rejoice:
      Fear not; thy God is near.

3   And when the final hour shall come,
      That calls thee to thy rest,
    To dwell within thy heavenly home,
      A welcome, joyful guest,
    Be calm; though Jordan's waves may roll,
      No ills shall meet thee there;
    Angels shall whisper to thy soul,
      Fear not; thy God is near.

      And bears up all the skies,
    Stretch from on high its friendly aid,
      When dangers round us rise?

3   On this support our souls shall lean,
      And banish every care;
    The gloomy vale of death will smile,
      If God be with us there.

4   While we his gracious succor prove,
      'Midst all our various ways,
    The darkest shades, through which we pass,

    Performs his work,--the cause conceals;
    But though his methods are unknown,
    Judgment and truth support his throne.

3   In heaven, and earth, and air, and seas,
    He executes his firm decrees;
    And by his saints it stands confessed
    That what he does is ever best.

3   Yet in the Lord will I be glad,
      And glory in his love;
    In him I'll joy, who will the God
      Of my salvation prove.

4   God is the treasure of my soul,
      The source of lasting joy--
    A joy which want shall not impair,
      Nor death itself destroy.

2   The hours of pain have yielded good,
      Which prosperous days refused;
    As herbs, though scentless when entire,
      Spread fragrance when they're bruised.

3   The oak strikes deeper as its boughs
      By furious blasts are driven;
    So life's vicissitudes the more
      Have fixed my heart in heaven.

4   All-gracious Lord! whate'er my lot
      In other times may be,
    I'll welcome still the heaviest grief,
      That brings me near to thee.

God Merciful in Affliction.


1   Mysterious are the ways of God,
      And fear and blindness oft repine;
    We murmur 'neath his chastening rod,
      Because we read not his design.

2   Impending clouds his love has spread
      O'er this low vale where mortals dwell;
    And oft we mourn his spirit fled,
      When adverse tempests round us swell.

3   But in those storms that sometimes roll,
      Our mortal dwellings dark above,
    Whose threatening shades dismay the soul,
      Dwells the bright presence of his love.

4   We cannot see him--not a ray
      Of all his glory there appears,
    And oft we thread our darkened way,
      Trembling with anxious doubts and fears.

5   Yet faith still looks beyond the gloom,
      While hope's bright star illumes our night;
    Pilgrims of earth! though dark the tomb,
      It leads to scenes of bliss and light.

1   O Thou who driest the mourner's tear,
      How dark this world would be,
    If, when deceived and wounded here,
      We could not fly to thee!

2   But thou wilt heal that broken heart,
      Which like the plants that throw
    Their fragrance from the wounded part,
      Breathes sweetness out of woe.

3   When joy no longer soothes or cheers,
      And e'en the hope that threw
    A moment's sparkle o'er our tears
      Is dimmed and vanished too;

4   O, who would bear life's stormy doom,
      Did not thy wing of love
    Come, brightly wafting through the gloom
      Our peace-branch from above?

5   Then sorrow touched by thee grows bright,
      With more than rapture's ray;
    The darkness shows us worlds of light
      We never saw by day.

"God is our refuge and strength; a very present help in trouble."


1   Bereft of all, when hopeless care
      Would sink us to the tomb,
    O what can save us from despair?
      What dissipate the gloom?

2   No balm that earthly plants distil
      Can soothe the mourner's smart;
    No mortal hand with lenient skill
      Bind up the broken heart.

3   But One alone, who reigns above,
      Our woe to peace can turn,
    And light the lamp of joy and love
      That long has ceased to burn.

4   Then, O my soul, to that One flee,
      To God thy woes reveal;
    His eye alone thy wounds can see,
      His hand alone can heal.




634.              L. M.                Montgomery.

The Same.


1   God is our refuge and defence,
      In trouble our unfailing aid;
    Secure in his omnipotence,
      What foe can make our soul afraid?

2   Yea, though the earth's foundations rock,
      And mountains down the gulf be hurled,
    His people smile amid the shock,
      They look beyond this transient world.

3   There is a river pure and bright,
      Whose streams make glad the heavenly plains,
    Where, in eternity of light,
      The city of our God remains.

4   Built by the word of his command,
      With his unclouded presence blessed,
    Firm as his throne the bulwarks stand;
      There is our home, our hope, our rest.

Trust amid the Severities of God.


1   Thou Power supreme, whose mighty scheme
      These woes of mine fulfil,
    Here, firm, I rest; they must be best,
      Because they are thy will.

2   Then all I want,--O do thou grant
      This one request of mine,--
    Since to enjoy thou dost deny,
      Assist me to resign.

Confidence in God.  Ps. 27.


1   God is my strong salvation;
      What foe have I to fear?
    In darkness and temptation
      My Light, my Help, is near.
    Though hosts encamp around me,
      Firm to the fight I stand;
    What terror can confound me
      With God at my right hand?

2   Place on the Lord reliance;
      My soul, with courage wait;
    His truth be thine affiance,
      When faint and desolate;
    His might thine heart shall strengthen;
      His love thy joy increase;
    Mercy thy days shall lengthen;
      The Lord will give thee peace.




637.              S. M.                  Moravian.

Reliance on God.


1     Give to the winds thy fears;
      Hope and be undismayed;
    God hears thy sighs, God counts thy tears;
      God shall lift up thy head.

2     Through waves, through clouds and storms,
      He gently clears thy way;
    Wait thou his time, so shall the night
      Soon end in joyous day.

3     He everywhere hath rule,
      And all things serve his might;
    His every act pure blessing is,
      His path unsullied light.

4     Thou seest our weakness, Lord,
      Our hearts are known to thee:
    O, lift thou up the sinking hand,
      Confirm the feeble knee!

5     Let us, in life or death,
      Boldly thy truth declare;
    And publish, with our latest breath,
      Thy love and guardian care.

Praising God in Life and in Death.


1   God of my life! through all its days
    My grateful powers shall sound thy praise;
    The song shall wake with opening light,
    And warble to the silent night.

2   When anxious cares would break my rest,
    And griefs would tear my throbbing breast,
    Thy tuneful praises, raised on high,
    Shall check the murmur and the sigh.

3   But, O, when that last conflict's o'er,
    And I am chained to flesh no more;
    With what glad accents shall I rise
    To join the music of the skies!

4   Soon shall I learn the exalted strains
    Which echo o'er the heavenly plains;
    And emulate, with joy unknown,
    The glowing seraphs round thy throne.

Faithfulness of God's Promise.


1     The promises I sing,
        Which sovereign love hath spoke;
      Nor will the eternal King
        His words of grace revoke;
          They stand secure,
    And steadfast still;
    Not Zion's hill
          Abides so sure.

2     The mountains melt away,
        When once the Judge appears,
      And sun and moon decay,
        That measure mortal years;
          But still the same,
    In radiant lines,
    The promise shines,
          Through all the flame.

Salvation.


1   Salvation! O, the joyful sound!
      'Tis pleasure to our ears,
    A sovereign balm for every wound,
      A cordial for our fears.

2   Buried in sorrow and in sin,
      At death's dark door we lay;
    But we arise, by grace divine,
      To see a heavenly day.

3   Salvation! let the echo fly
      The spacious earth around,
    While all the armies of the sky
      Conspire to raise the sound.

Praise from Earth and Heaven.


1   Praise the Lord! ye heavens adore him;
      Praise him, angels in the height;
    Sun and moon rejoice before him;
      Praise him, all ye stars of light!
    Praise the Lord, for he hath spoken;
      Worlds his mighty voice obeyed;
    Laws which never can be broken,
      For their guidance he hath made.

2   Praise the Lord! for he is glorious,
      Never shall his promise fail;
    God hath made his saints victorious,
      Sin and death shall not prevail:
    Praise the God of our salvation,
      Hosts on high his power proclaim;
    Heaven and earth, and all creation,
      Praise and magnify his name!

Experience of God's Grace.


1   When God revealed his gracious name,
      And changed my mournful state,
    My rapture seemed a pleasing dream,
      The grace appeared so great.

2   The world beheld the glorious change,
      And did thy hand confess;
    My tongue broke out in unknown strains,
      And sung surprising grace.

3   The Lord can clear the darkest skies,
      Can give us day for night;
    Make drops of sacred sorrow rise
      To rivers of delight.

4   Let those, who sow in sadness, wait
      Till the fair harvest come;
    They shall confess their sheaves are great,
      And shout the blessings home.




643.              C. M.                   Beddome.

Fear not.


1   Ye trembling souls, dismiss your fears;
      Be mercy all your theme;
    For mercy like a river flows,
      In one perpetual stream.

2   Fear not the powers of earth and hell;
      God will those powers restrain;
    His arm will all their rage repel,
      And make their efforts vain.

3   Fear not the want of outward good;
      For his he will provide,
    Grant them supplies of daily food,
      And give them heaven beside.

4   Fear not that he will e'er forsake,
      Or leave his work undone;
    He's faithful to his promises,
      And faithful to his Son.

Rejoicing in God, our Father.


1   Come, shout aloud the Father's grace,
      And sing the Saviour's love;
    Soon shall you join the glorious theme,
      In loftier strains above.

2   God, the eternal, mighty God,
      To dearer names descends;
    Calls us his treasure and his joy,
      His children and his friends.

3   My Father, God! and may these lips
      Pronounce a name so dear?
    Not thus could heaven's sweet harmony
      Delight my listening ear.

4   Thanks to my God for every gift
      His bounteous hands bestow;
    And thanks eternal for that love
      Whence all these comforts flow.

      Oh grant me an abode
    Among the churches of thy saints,
      The temples of my God!

3   There shall I offer my requests,
      And see thy beauty still;
    Shall hear thy messages of love,
      And there inquire thy will.

4   When troubles rise and storms appear,
      There may his children hide:
    God has a strong pavilion, where
      He makes my soul abide.

5   Now shall my head be lifted high
      Above my foes around,
    And songs of joy and victory
      Within thy temple sound.

      Of thy redeeming love.

2   Soon as the morn with roses
      Bedecks the dewy east,
    And when the sun reposes
      Upon the ocean's breast;
    My voice in supplication,
      My Saviour, thou shalt hear:
    O grant me thy salvation,
      And to my soul draw near.

3   Thy gracious love possessing
      In all my pilgrim road,
    My soul shall feel thy blessing
      In thy divine abode.
    There bowing down before thee,
      My every conflict o'er,
    My spirit shall adore thee,

Triumph.


1   Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness!
      Awake! for thy foes shall oppress thee no more;
    Bright o'er thy hills dawns the day-star of gladness,
      Arise! for the night of thy sorrow is o'er.

2   Strong were thy foes, but the arm that subdued them
      And scattered their legions was mightier far;
    They fled like the chaff from the scourge that pursued them,
      Vain were their steeds and their chariots of war.

3   Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee
      Extolled with the harp and the timbrel should be;
    Shout! for the foe is destroyed that enslaved thee;
      Th' oppressor is vanquished, and Zion is free.

      His hand supplies me still;
    In pastures green he makes me lie,
      Beside the rippling rill:
    He cheers my soul, relieves my woes,
      His glory to display;
    The paths of righteousness he shows,
      And leads me in his way.

2   Though walking through death's dismal shade,
      No evil will I fear;
    Thy rod, thy staff shall lend me aid,
      For thou art ever near:
    For me a table thou dost spread
      In presence of my foes;
    With oil thou dost anoint my head;
      By thee my cup o'erflows.

3   Thy goodness and thy mercy sure
      Shall bless me all my days;
    And I, with lips sincere and pure,
      Will celebrate thy praise:
    Yes, in the temple of the Lord
      Forever I will dwell;
    To after time thy name record,
      And of thy glory tell.

The Cross of Christ.


1   In the cross of Christ I glory,
      Towering o'er the wrecks of time;
    All the light of sacred story
      Gathers round its head sublime.

2   When the woes of life o'ertake me,
      Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
    Never shall the cross forsake me;
      Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

3   When the sun of bliss is beaming
      Light and love upon my way,
    From the cross the radiance streaming
      Adds more lustre to the day.

4   Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
      By the cross are sanctified;
    Peace is there that knows no measure,
      Joys that through all time abide.

    The rich in flattering riches trust,
      Which take their everlasting flight.

      The most gigantic strength of man;
    And where is all his wisdom gone,
      When dust he turns to dust again?

      I triumph in the love divine,
    The wisdom, wealth, and strength of grace
      In Christ through endless ages mine.

      Through all the blissful road,
    Till to the sacred mount you rise,
      And see your Father, God.

3   There garlands of immortal joy
      Shall bloom on every head,
    While sorrow, sighing, and distress,
      Like shadows all are fled.

4   March on in your Redeemer's strength,
      Pursue his footsteps still,
    And let the prospect cheer your eye

Grace first and last in Salvation.


1     Grace! 'tis a charming sound!
      Harmonious to the ear!
    Heaven with the echo shall resound,
      And all the earth shall hear.

2     Grace first contrived the way
      To save rebellious man;
    And all the steps that grace display
      Which drew the wondrous plan.

3     Grace led my roving feet
      To tread the heavenly road;
    And new supplies each hour I meet
      While pressing on to God.

4     Grace taught my soul to pray,
      And made my eyes o'erflow;
    'Twas grace that kept me to this day,
      And will not let me go.

5     Grace all the work shall crown,
      Through everlasting days;
    It lays in heaven the topmost stone,
      And well deserves the praise.

"Glorious things spoken of Zion."


1   Glorious things of thee are spoken,
      Zion, city of our God!
    He whose word cannot be broken
      Formed thee for his own abode.
    On the Rock of Ages founded,
      What can shake thy sure repose?
    With salvation's walls surrounded,
      Thou mayst smile at all thy foes.

2   See! the streams of living waters,
      Springing from eternal love,
    Well supply thy sons and daughters,
      And all fear of want remove.
    Who can faint while such a river
      Ever flows their thirst t' assuage?
    Grace, which, like the Lord the giver,
      Never fails from age to age.

3   Round each habitation hovering,
      See the cloud and fire appear!
    For a glory and a covering,
      Showing that the Lord is near.
    Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
      All his boasted pomp and show;
    Solid joys and lasting treasure
      None but Zion's children know.

2     Bulwarks of grace defend
      The city where we dwell,
    While walls, of strong salvation made,
      Defy th' assaults of hell.

3     Lift up th' eternal gates;
      The doors wide open fling;
    Enter, ye nations that obey
      The statutes of your King.

4     Here taste unmingled joys,
      And live in perfect peace,
    You that have known Jehovah's name,
      And ventured on his grace.

5     Trust in the Lord, ye saints,
      And banish all your fears;
    Strength in the Lord Jehovah dwells,
      Eternal as his years.

The Jewish and the Christian Zion.  Ps. 48.


1   With stately towers and bulwarks strong,
      Unrivalled and alone,
    Loved theme of many a sacred song,
      God's holy city shone.

2   Thus fair was Zion's chosen seat,
      The glory of all lands;
    Yet fairer, and in strength complete,
      The Christian temple stands.

3   The faithful of each clime and age
      This glorious church compose;
    Built on a rock, with idle rage
      The threatening tempest blows.

4   In vain may hostile bands alarm,
      For God is her defence;
    How weak, how powerless is each arm,
      Against Omnipotence!

      Their songs of honor raise.

2     Let strangers walk around
      The city where we dwell,
    Survey with care thine holy ground,
      And mark the building well,--

3     The order of thy house,
      The worship of thy court,
    The cheerful songs, the solemn vows,
      And make a fair report.

4     How decent and how wise!
      How glorious to behold!
    Beyond the pomp that charms the eyes,
      And rites adorned with gold.

5     The God we worship now
      Will guide us till we die,--
    Will be our God while here below,
      And ours above the sky.

      For her my prayers ascend;
    To her my cares and toils be given,
      Till toils and cares shall end.

3     Beyond my highest joy
      I prize her heavenly ways,
    Her sweet communion, solemn vows,
      Her hymns of love and praise.

4     Father and Friend divine,
      Our Saviour and our King,
    Thy hand, from every snare and foe,
      Shall great deliverance bring.

5     Sure as thy truth shall last,
      To Zion shall be given
    The brightest glories earth can yield,
      And brighter bliss of heaven.

3   In prayer, in effort, tears, and toils,
      One Wisdom be our guide;
    Taught by one Spirit from above,
      In thee may we abide.

4   Around this feeble, trusting band
      Thy sheltering pinions spread,
    Nor let the storms of trial beat
      Too fiercely on our head.

    Shall anthems of immortal praise,

      O, come in Jesus' precious name;
    We welcome thee with one accord,
      And trust the Saviour does the same.

2   Those joys which earth cannot afford,
      We'll seek in fellowship to prove,
    Joined in one spirit to our Lord,
      Together bound by mutual love.

3   And while we pass this vale of tears,
      We'll make our joys and sorrows known;
    We'll share each other's hopes and fears,
      And count a brother's care our own.

4   Once more our welcome we repeat;
      Receive assurance of our love:
    O, may we all together meet
      Around the throne of God above!

A Welcome to Fellowship.


1   Approach thou blesséd of the Lord;
      Stranger nor foe art thou:
    We welcome thee with warm accord,
      Our friend, our brother, now.

2   The hand of fellowship, the heart
      Of love, we offer thee:
    Leaving the world, thou dost but part
      From lies and vanity.

3   The cup of blessing which we bless,
      The heavenly bread we break,
    Our Saviour's blood and righteousness,--
      Freely with us partake.

On Joining the Church.


1   O, happy day, that fixed my choice
      On thee, my Saviour and my Lord!
    Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
      And tell its raptures all abroad!

2   O, happy bond, that seals my vows
      To Him who merits all my love!
    Let cheerful anthems fill the house,
      While to his altar now I move.

3   Now rest, my long-divided heart;
      Fixed on this blissful centre, rest;
    Here have I found a nobler part;
      Here heavenly pleasures fill my breast.

4   High Heaven, that hears the solemn vow,
      That vow renewed shall daily hear;
    Till in life's latest hour I bow,
      And bless in death a bond so dear.

Dedication of Children to God and Christ.


1   See Israel's gentle Shepherd stand,
      With all-engaging charms;
    Hark! how he calls the tender lambs,
      And folds them in his arms!

2   "Permit them to approach," he cries,
      "Nor scorn their humble name;
    For 'twas to bless such souls as these,
      The Lord of angels came."

3   We bring them, Lord, in thankful hands,
      And yield them up to thee;
    Joyful that we ourselves are thine,
      Thine let our offspring be.

4   Ye little flock, with pleasure hear;
      Ye children, seek his face,
    And fly with transport to receive
      The blessings of his grace.

5   If orphans they are left behind,
      God's guardian care we trust;
    That care shall heal our bleeding hearts,
      If weeping o'er their dust.

Infants, living or dying, in the Arms of Christ.


1   Thy life I read, my dearest Lord,
      With transport all-divine;
    Thine image trace in every word,
      Thy love in every line.

2   With joy, I see a thousand charms
      Spread o'er thy lovely face;
    While infants in thy tender arms
      Receive the smiling grace.

3   "I take these little lambs," said he,
      "And lay them on my breast;
    Protection they shall find in me,--
      In me be ever blest.

4   "Death may the bands of life unloose,
      But can't dissolve my love;
    Millions of infant souls compose
      The family above."

5   His words, ye happy parents, hear,
      And shout, with joys divine,
    "Dear Saviour! all we have and are
      Shall be forever thine."

Dedication of Children.


1   This child we dedicate to thee,
    O God of grace and purity;
    Shield it from sin and threatening wrong,
    And let thy love its life prolong.

2   O, may thy Spirit gently draw
    Its willing soul to keep thy law;
    May virtue, piety and truth
    Dawn even with its dawning youth.

3   Grant that, with true and faithful heart,
    We too may act the Christian's part,
    Cheered by each promise thou hast given,
    And laboring for the prize in heaven.

Children commended to Christ.


1   Saviour, who thy flock art feeding
      With the shepherd's kindest care,
    All the feeble gently leading,
      While the lambs thy bosom share,--

2   Now, these little ones receiving,
      Fold them in thy gracious arm;
    There, we know--thy word believing,--
      Only there, secure from harm.

3   Never, from thy pasture roving,
      Let them be the lion's prey;
    Let thy tenderness, so loving,
      Keep them all life's dangerous way.

4   Then within thy fold eternal
      Let them find a resting-place;
    Feed in pastures ever vernal,
      Drink the rivers of thy grace.

Christ calling Children to Himself.


1     The Saviour gently calls
      Our children to his breast;
    He folds them in his gracious arms;
      Himself declares them blest.

2     "Let them approach," he cries,
      "Nor scorn their humble claim;
    The heirs of heaven are such as these,--
      For such as these I came."

3     Gladly we bring them, Lord,
      Devoting them to thee:
    Imploring, that, as we are thine,
      Thine may our offspring be.

Infant Baptism.


1   Drop the limpid waters now
    On the infant's sinless brow;
    Dedicate the unfolding gem
    Unto Him, who blessed the stem.

2   Let our aspirations be
    Innocent as infancy;
    Pure the prayers that force their way,
    As the child for whom we pray.

3   In the Christian garden we
    Plant another Christian tree;
    Be its blossoms and its fruit
    Worthy of the Christian root.

4   To that garden now we bring
    Waters from the living spring;
    Bless the tree, the waters bless,
    Holy One! with holiness.

5   When life's harvests all are past,
    Oh, transplant the tree at last,
    To the fields where flower and tree
    Blossom through eternity.

Hymn for Baptism.


1   Baptized into our Saviour's death,
      Our souls to sin must die;
    With Christ our Lord we live anew,
      With Christ ascend on high.

2   There, by his Father's side he sits,
      Enthroned divinely fair,
    Yet owns himself our Brother still,
      And our Forerunner there.

3   Rise from these earthly trifles, rise
      On wings of faith and love;
    Above our choicest treasure lies,--
      And be our hearts above.

4   But earth and sin will draw us down,
      When we attempt to fly;
    Lord, send thy strong, attractive power
      To fix our souls on high.

Baptism.


1     Saviour, thy law we love,
      Thy pure example bless,
    And with a firm, unwavering zeal,
      Would in thy footsteps press.

2     Not to the fiery pains
      By which the martyrs bled;
    Not to the scourge, the thorn, the cross,
      Our favored feet are led;--

3     But, at this peaceful tide,
      Assembled in thy fear,
    The homage of obedient hearts
      We humbly offer here.

After Baptism.


1   Let plenteous grace descend on those,
      Who, hoping in thy word,
    This day have solemnly declared
      That Jesus is their Lord.

2   With cheerful feet may they advance,
      And run the Christian race,
    And, through the troubles of the way,
      Find all-sufficient grace.

3   Lord, plant us all into thy death,
      That we thy life may prove,--
    Partakers of thy cross beneath,
      And of thy crown above.

The Same.


1   'Tis done; the great transaction's done;
      I am my Lord's, and he is mine:
    He drew me, and I followed on,
      Rejoiced to own the call divine.

2   Now rest, my long divided heart;
      Fixed on this blissful centre, rest:
    Here have I found a nobler part;
      Here heavenly pleasures fill my breast.

3   High heaven, that hears the solemn vow,
      That vow renewed shall daily hear,
    Till in life's latest hour I bow,
      And bless in death a bond so dear.

1   Prepare us, Lord, to view thy cross,
      Who all our griefs hast borne;
    To look on thee, whom we have pierced,--
      To look on thee, and mourn.

2   While thus we mourn we would rejoice;
      And, as thy cross we see,
    Let each exclaim in faith and hope,
      "The Saviour died for me!"

Proper Dispositions for the Communion.


1   O here, if ever, God of love!
      Let strife and hatred cease;
    And every thought harmonious move,
      And every heart be peace.

2   Not here, where met to think on him,
      Whose latest thoughts were ours,
    Shall mortal passions come to dim
      The prayer devotion pours.

3   No, gracious Master, not in vain
      Thy life of love hath been;
    The peace thou gav'st may yet remain,
      Though thou no more art seen.

4   "Thy kingdom come;" we watch, we wait,
      To hear thy cheering call;
    When heaven shall ope its glorious gate.
      And God be all in all.

Institution of the Lord's Supper.


1   'Twas on that dark, that doleful night,
      When all the powers of darkness rose
    Against the Son of God's delight,
      And friends betrayed him to his foes:

2   Before the mournful scene began,
      He took the bread, and blessed, and brake:
    What love through all his actions ran!
      What wondrous words of grace he spake!

3   "This is my body broke for sin;
      Receive and eat the living food:"
    Then took the cup and blessed the wine,--
      "'Tis the new covenant in my blood."

4   "Do this," he said, "till time shall end,
      In memory of your dying Friend;
    Meet at my table, and record
      The love of your departed Lord."

5   Jesus! thy feast we celebrate;
      We show thy death, we sing thy name,
    Till thou return, and we shall eat
      The marriage supper of the Lamb.

2   Yes, we'll record thy matchless love,
      Thou dearest, tenderest, best of friends!
    Thy dying love the noblest praise
      Our hearts can offer thee transcends.

3   'Tis pleasure more than earth can give
      Thy goodness through these veils to see,
    Thy table food celestial yields,
      And happy they who sit with thee.

      'Tis his virtues we proclaim;

2     O Thou, who didst allow
      Thy Son to suffer thus,
    Father, what more couldst thou have done
      Than thou hast done for us?

3     We are persuaded now
      That nothing can divide
    Thy children from thy boundless love,
      Displayed in him who died;--

4     Who died to make us sure
      Of mercy, truth and peace,
    And from the power and pains of sin
      To bring a full release.

1   Behold, amid his little flock,
      The Saviour stands serene,
    Unawed by suffering yet to be,
      Unchanged by what hath been.

2   Still beams the light of love undimmed
      In that benignant eye,
    Nor, save his own prophetic word,
      Aught speaks him soon to die.

3   He pours within the votive cup
      The rich blood of the vine,
    And "Drink ye all the hallowed draught,"
      He cries, "This blood is mine."

4   He breaks the bread; then clasps his hands,
      And lifts his eyes in prayer,
    Receive ye this and view by faith
      My body symbolled there.

      Who round his table draw!
    Remember what his spirit was,
      What his peculiar law.

2   The love which all his bosom filled
      Did all his actions guide;
    Inspired by love, he lived and taught;
      Inspired by love, he died.

3   And do you love him? do you feel
      Your warm affection move?
    This is the proof which he demands,--
      That you each other love.

2   Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
      Save in the death of Christ, my Lord;
    All the vain things that charm me most,
      I sacrifice them to his blood.

3   See from his head, his hands, his feet,
      Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
    Did e'er such love and sorrow meet?
      Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

4   Were the whole realm of nature mine,
      That were a present far too small;
    Love so amazing, so divine,
      Demands my soul, my life, my all.

    May our souls, refreshment finding,
      Grow in all things like our Head.

On Laying the Corner-stone of a Church.


1   This stone to thee in faith we lay,--
      We build the temple, Lord, to thee,
    Thine eye be open night and day,
      To guard this house from error free.

2   Here, when thy people seek thy face,
      And dying sinners pray to live,
    Hear thou, in heaven thy dwelling-place,
      And when thou hearest, Lord, forgive.

3   Here, when thy messengers proclaim
      The blesséd gospel of thy Son,
    Still by the power of his great name
      Be mighty signs and wonders done.

4   When children's voices raise the song,
      Hosanna! to their Heavenly King,
    Let heaven with earth the strain prolong;
      Hosanna! let the angels sing.

5   Thy glory never hence depart;
      Yet choose not, Lord, this house alone;
    Thy kingdom come to every heart;
      In every bosom fix thy throne.

Dedication Hymn.


1   The perfect world by Adam trod,
    Was the first temple,--built by God;
    His fiat laid the corner-stone,
    And heaved its pillars, one by one.

2   He hung its starry roof on high,--
    The broad, illimitable sky;
    He spread its pavement, green and bright
    And curtained it with morning light.

3   The mountains in their places stood,--
    The sea, the sky,--and "all was good;"
    And when its first pure praises rang,
    The "morning stars together sang."

4   Lord! 'tis not ours to make the sea,
    And earth and sky a house for thee;
    But in thy sight our offering stands,
    A humbler temple, "made with hands."

1   O, bow thine ear, Eternal One!
      On thee our heart adoring calls;
    To thee the followers of thy Son
      Have raised and now devote these walls.

2   Here let thy holy days be kept;
      And be this place to worship given,
    Like that bright spot where Jacob slept,
      The house of God, the gate of heaven.

3   Here may thine honor dwell; and here,
      As incense, let thy children's prayer,
    From contrite hearts and lips sincere,
      Rise on the still and holy air.

4   Here be thy praise devoutly sung;
      Here let thy truth beam forth to save,
    As when, of old, thy spirit hung,
      On wings of light, o'er Jordan's wave.

5   And when the lips, that with thy name
      Are vocal now, to dust shall turn,
    On others may devotion's flame
      Be kindled here, and purely burn!

1   Father, lo! we consecrate
      Unto thee this house and shrine,
    Oh! may Jesus visit here,
      As he did in Palestine.
    Here may blind eyes see his light,
      Deaf ears hear his accents sweet,
    And we, like those groups of old,
      Sit and linger at his feet.

2   And to learn of faith and love,
      Strong in sorrow, pain and loss,
    May we come and find them here,
      In the garden, on the cross.
    Like the spices that enfold
      Him we love in rich perfume,
    May our thoughts embalm him here,
      While he slumbers in the tomb.

3   When we watch by shrouded hopes,
      Weeping at death's marble door,
    May the angels meet us here--
      Lo! your Christ has gone before!
    And while we stand "looking up,"
      In our faith and wonder lost,
    Here send down thy Spirit's power,
      Like the tongues of Pentecost.

God's Temple in the Heart.


1   Who shall a temple build for him,
      Who fills the heaven of heavens alone?
    Who shall exalt his glorious name,
      Fixed in his everlasting throne?

2   Yet many a lowly fane shall rise,
      Which God himself will not disdain:
    He will accept the sacrifice;
      Nor shall the offering e'er be vain.

3   No gorgeous dome, nor boastful vow,
      Can e'er find favor in his sight:
    The humble votary, meek and low,--
      The holy soul, are his delight.

4   On these his grace and mercy rest,
      Nor from their shrines will he depart:
    His temple is the righteous breast;
      His altar is the pious heart.

1     Thou Fount of love and grace,

      Unveil thy smiling face,
        And to our souls draw nigh;
    And let our prayers and praise arise,
    Like grateful incense to the skies.

2     This house to thee we give--
        Thine may it ever be--
      Here bid the sinner live,
        Here set the captive free,
    Here let thy word its beams display
    And safely guide to endless day.

3     Here may the stricken heart
        By truth be cheered and blessed,
      And here thy grace impart,
        To all by grief oppressed--
    And streams of peace and plenty flow,
    To all who seek thy joy to know.

4     Long may these walls resound
        With thy salvation, Lord,
      And grace to all abound,
        Who hear thy holy word--
    And youth and age their offerings raise.
    In songs of ardent, cheerful praise.

Dedication of a Country Church.


1   On this fair spot where nature pays
      From hill, and vale, and flower, and tree,
    In morning beams, in evening rays,
      Its homage, God of all, to thee;--

2   Thy children meet to dedicate
      This temple to thy gracious name;
    Our hearts and songs to elevate,--
      Thy grace and glory to proclaim.

3   Descend--and with thy spirit bless
      The offering; may it ever be
    Sacred to truth and righteousness,
      From error's dread dominion free.

4   Here let the standard of thy word
      Be raised and held by gospel hands;
    Hither bring hearts with one accord,
      To learn and do thy great commands.

5   And when we leave these courts below,
      To join the hosts in praise above,
    May others here rejoice to know
      Thy boundless, everlasting love.

1   O Thou, whose own vast temple stands,
      Built over earth and sea,
    Accept the walls that human hands
      Have raised to worship thee.

2   Lord, from thine inmost glory send,
      Within these courts to bide,
    The peace that dwelleth, without end,
      Serenely by thy side.

3   May erring minds that worship here
      Be taught the better way,
    And they who mourn, and they who fear,
      Be strengthened as they pray!

4   May faith grow firm, and love grow warm,
      And pure devotion rise,
    While round these hallowed walls the storm
      Of earth-born passion dies!

1   Where shall we go to seek and find
      A habitation for our God?
    A dwelling for th' Eternal Mind
      Among the sons of flesh and blood?

2   The God of Jacob chose the hill
      Of Zion for his ancient rest;
    And Zion is his dwelling still;
      His church is with his presence blest.

3   Here will he meet the hungry poor,
      And fill their souls with living bread;
    Here sinners, waiting at his door,
      With sweet provision shall be fed.

4   "Here will I fix my gracious throne,
      And reign forever," saith the Lord;
    "Here shall my power and love be known,
      And blessings shall attend my word."

    How God can dwell with men below.

2     Here may thine ears attend
        Our interceding cries,
      And grateful praise ascend,
        Like incense to the skies:
    Here may thy word melodious sound,
    And spread celestial joys around.

3     Here may our unborn sons
        And daughters sound thy praise,
      And shine, like polished stones,
        Through long-succeeding days:
    Here, Lord, display thy saving power,
    While temples stand and men adore.

4     Here may the listening throng
        Imbibe thy truth and love;
      Here Christians join the song
        Of seraphim above;
    Till all, who humbly seek thy face,
    Rejoice in thy abounding grace.

1   Our Father God! not face to face

      Where dwells thy secret Majesty.
    Yet whereso'er our spirits bend
      In rev'rent faith and humble prayer,
    Thy promised blessing will descend,
      And we shall find thy spirit there.

2   Lord! be the spot where now we meet,
      An open gateway into heaven;
    Here may we sit at Jesus' feet,
      And feel our deepest sins forgiven.
    Here may desponding care look up;
      And sorrow lay its burden down,
    Or learn, of him, to drink the cup,
      To bear the cross, and win the crown.

3   Here may the sick and wandering soul,
      To truth still blind, to sin a slave,
    Find better than Bethesda's pool,
      Or than Siloam's healing wave.
    And may we learn, while here apart
      From the world's passion and its strife
    That thy true shrine's a loving heart,
      And thy best praise a holy life!

2   We kneel in praise, that here is set
      A vine that by thy culture grew;
    We kneel in prayer, that thou wouldst wet
      Its opening leaves with heavenly dew.

3   Since thy young servant now hath given
      Himself, his powers, his hopes, his youth
    To the great cause of truth and heaven,
      Be thou his guide, O God of truth!

4   Here may his doctrines drop like rain,
      His speech like Hermon's dew distil,
    Till green fields smile, and golden grain,
      Ripe for the harvest, waits thy will.

5   And when he sinks in death,--by care,
      Or pain, or toil, or years oppressed,--
    O God! remember then our prayer,
      And take his spirit to thy rest.

Benefits of the Ministry.


1   Blest is the hour when cares depart,
        And earthly scenes are far,--
    When tears of woe forget to start,
    And gently dawns upon the heart
        Devotion's holy star.

2   Blest is the place where angels bend
        To hear our worship rise,
    Where kindred thoughts their musings blend,
    And all the soul's affections tend
        Beyond the veiling skies.

3   Blest are the hallowed vows that bind
        Man to his work of love,--
    Bind him to cheer the humble mind,
    Console the weeping, lead the blind,
        And guide to joys above.

4   Sweet shall the song of glory swell,
        Spirit divine to thee,
    When they whose work is finished well,
    In thy own courts of rest shall dwell,
        Blest through eternity.

1   O Thou, who on thy chosen Son

    To mark the long expected one,
      And seal the messenger of love;

2   And when the heralds of his name
      Went forth his glorious truth to spread,
    Didst send it down in tongues of flame
      To hallow each devoted head;

3   So, Lord, thy servant now inspire
      With holy unction from above;
    Give him the tongue of living fire,
      Give him the temper of the dove.

      Who takes his station here,

2   A pure disciple, let him tread
      The ways his Master trod--
    Giving the weary spirits rest,
      Leading the lost to God--
    Stooping to lend the sufferer aid,
      Crushed sorrow's wail to hear,
    To bind the widow's broken heart,
      And dry the orphan's tear.

3   For war with error, make him strong,
      And sin, the soul's dark foe--
    But let him humbly seek for truth,
      Where'er its waters flow.
    And when, O Father, at the grave
      He lays his armor down,
    Give him the victor's glistening robe,
      The palm-wreath and the crown.

      Compassing our Zion round;
    Know in truth thine own resources,

2   Christ proclaim in the new station,
      Herald, now assigned to thee;
    That the waiting congregation
      God's salvation here may see.
    Christ proclaim--no line abating

    From no promise deviating;
      From no precept; "preach the word."

3   Then, God's blessing resting o'er thee,
      And his truth, by night, by day,
    Cloud and pillar bright before thee,
      Shall make glad thy gospel way;

719.              C. M.                 Doddridge.

For a Meeting of Ministers.


1   Let Zion's watchmen all awake,
      And take the alarm they give:
    Now let them, from the mouth of God,
      Their solemn charge receive.

2   'Tis not a cause of small import
      The pastor's care demands;
    But what might fill an angel's heart,
      And filled a Saviour's hands.

3   May they, that Jesus whom they preach,
      Their own Redeemer see;
    And watch thou daily o'er their souls,
      That they may watch for thee.

Burden and Conflict of the Ministry.


1   Onward, Christian, though the region
      Where thou art be drear and lone;
    God hath set a guardian legion
      Very near thee,--press thou on!

2   By the thorn-wood, and none other,
      Is the mount of vision won;
    Tread it without shrinking, brother!
      Jesus trod it,--press thou on!

3   By thy trustful, calm endeavor,
      Guiding, cheering, like the sun,
    Earth-bound hearts thou shalt deliver
      O, for their sake, press thou on!

4   Be this world the wiser, stronger,
      For thy life of pain and peace;
    While it needs thee, O, no longer
      Pray thou for thy quick release.

5   Pray thou, Christian, daily, rather,
      That thou be a faithful son;
    By the prayer of Jesus,--"Father,
      Not my will, but thine, be done!"




721.              L. M.                A. Balfour.

Ministers Charged and Encouraged.


1   Go, messengers of peace and love,
      To people plunged in shades of night;
    Like angels sent from fields above,
      Be yours to shed celestial light.

2   Go to the hungry,--food impart;
      To paths of peace the wanderer guide;
    And lead the thirsty panting heart
      Where streams of living water glide.

3   O faint not in the day of toil,
      When harvest waits the reaper's hand;
    Go, gather in the glorious spoil,
      And joyous in his presence stand.

4   Thy love a rich reward shall find
      From him who sits enthroned on high;
    For they who turn the erring mind
      Shall shine like stars above the sky.

Call to Labor in God's Vineyard.


1     The vineyard of the Lord
      Before his laborers lies;
    And, lo! we see the vast reward
      Which waits us in the skies.

2     O let us then proceed
      In God's great work below,
    And following our triumphant Head,
      To further conquests go.

3     And let our heart and mind
      Continually ascend,
    That haven of repose to find,
      Where all our labors end.

4     What honor to behold,
      In that sublime abode,
    The patriarchs and prophets old,
      And all the men of God!

5     Then spend our days beneath,
      Toiling in cheerful hope;
    And fearless pass the vale of death,
      And gain the mountain top.




723.              L. M.            Episcopal Coll.

For Laborers in God's Harvest.


1   O Spirit of the living God,
      In all thy plenitude of grace,
    Where'er the foot of man hath trod,
      Descend on our degenerate race!

2   Give tongues of fire and hearts of love,
      To preach the reconciling word;
    Give power and unction from above,
      Where'er the joyful sound is heard.

3   Be darkness, at thy coming, light;
      Confusion, order, in thy path;
    Souls without strength inspire with might;
      Bid mercy triumph over wrath.

4   Convert the nations; far and nigh
      The triumphs of the cross record;
    The name of Jesus glorify,
      Till every people call him Lord.

A Blessing invoked on Christian Teachers.


1   Mighty One, before whose face,
      Wisdom had her glorious seat,
    When the orbs that people space
      Sprang to birth beneath thy feet;

2   Source of truth, whose rays alone
      Light the mighty world of mind;
    God of love, who from thy throne
      Kindly watchest all mankind;

3   Shed on those, who in thy name
      Teach the way of truth and right,
    Shed that love's undying flame,
      Shed that wisdom's guiding light.




725.              L. M.                 H. Ballou.

At an Annual Convention.


1   Dear Lord, behold thy servants, here,
      From various parts together meet,
    To tell their labors through the year,
      And lay the harvest at thy feet.

2   The reapers cry, "Thy fields are white,
      All ready to be gathered in,
    And harvests wave in changing light,
      Far as the eye can trace the scene."

3   Lord, bless us while we here remain;
      With holy love our bosoms fill;
    O may thy doctrine drop like rain,
      And like the silent dew distil.

4   While we attend thy churches' care
      O grant us wisdom from above;
    With prudent thought and humble prayer,
      May we fulfil the works of love.

The Same.


1   Brethren, beloved for Jesus' sake,
      A hearty welcome here receive;
    May we together now partake
      The joys which he alone can give.

2   May he by whose kind care we meet,
      Send his good Spirit from above,
    Make our communion pure and sweet,
      And cause our hearts to burn with love.

3   Forgotten be each worldly theme,
      When thus we meet, to pray and praise;
    We but desire to speak of him,
      And of his holy word and ways.

4   Thus as the moments pass away,
      We'll love, and wonder and adore;
    Then hasten on, the glorious day,
      When we shall meet to part no more.

1   Joined in a union firm and strong,
      No foe our ranks can break;
    To victory we press along,
      And glorious warfare make.
    Our fervent prayers shall still prevail
      Against a host of sins;
    And angels every Christian hail
      Whose love a conquest wins.

2   Then let our ranks, more closely joined,
      With shield and buckler stand;
    A kingdom we at last shall find,
      The promised spirit-land.
    Let all with harmony of voice,
      In lofty praises join;
    Let every soul in Christ rejoice,
      With rapture all divine.

3   The kindling flame begins to glow,
      Each heart grows warm with love;
    And we enjoy on earth below,
      The bliss of heaven above!
    O thus forever may we feel,
      And evermore display
    Devotion's pure and holy zeal,
      In Zion's chosen way.

1   Our Father--ever living!
      Once more thy children come,
    In joy and true thanksgiving,
      To this their gospel home.
    United--from dissension
      Kept by thy goodness free--
    Again in glad Convention
      Our vows we pay to thee.

2   The Past! Its ways are beaming
      With thy sure mercies, Lord--
    Thy truth and grace redeeming,
      Sent o'er the earth abroad,
    The hoary shrines of error
      Have cast aside; and free
    From darkness, doubt, and terror
      Its children come to thee.

3   The Present! Loudly sounding,
      Its cheering tones are heard;
    Be our full hearts abounding
      In its strong Hope and Word!
    Be strength and wisdom, Father!
      Bestowing what we need,
    Truth's harvest-sheaves to gather--
      Christ's kingdom here to speed.

4   The Future! Indications
      Of mightier works are there:--
    Truth's promised revelations;
      Thine arm of power made bare;
    From sin's dread reign exemption:
      Man's life in Christ, divine;
    The erring world's redemption;
      The glory, Father, thine!

The Same.


1   We gather in the name of God,
      And, bowing down the head,
    We stretch our waiting hands abroad,
      And humbly ask for aid:
    For aid, when o'er the spirit's day,
      Thick clouds of darkness rest,
    That we may chase the gloom away,
      And light the darkened breast.

2   For strength to lead the poor, the weak
      Who tread the vale of years,--
    For pity's hand to dry the cheek
      Where sorrow sits in tears;
    For hope, the beautiful and bright,
      That whispers, "Ne'er despond!"
    For faith, that through the darkest night
      Still sees a star beyond.

3   Bold heralds of the cross, O God,
      Undaunted send us forth;
    Salvation be our rallying word,--
      Our field, the boundless earth;
    Love on our lips, and in our soul,
      Our labors never done;
    O Sovereign Helper! till the goal
      By all at last be won.

Closing Hymn at an Association.


1   Christians! brethren! ere we part,
    Every voice and every heart
    Join, and to our Father raise
    One last hymn of grateful praise.

2   Though we here should meet no more,
    Yet there is a brighter shore;
    There, released from toil and pain,
    There we all may meet again.

3   Now to him who reigns in heaven
    Be eternal glory given;
    Grateful for thy love divine,
    O may all our hearts be thine!

The Same.


1   Hail, sweetest, dearest tie that binds
      Our glowing hearts in one;
    Hail, sacred hope, that tunes our minds
      To sing what God hath done.
    It is the hope, the blissful hope,
      Which gospel grace hath given;
    The hope, when days and years are past,
      We all shall meet in heaven.

2   From eastern shores, from northern lands,
      From western hill and plain,
    From southern climes, the brother-bands
      May hope to meet again;
    It is the hope, the blissful hope,
      Which love divine hath given:
    The hope, when life and time are o'er,
      We all shall meet in heaven.

3   No hope deferred, no parting sigh,
      That blessed meeting knows;
    There friendship beams from every eye,
      And hope immortal grows.
    It is the hope, the precious hope,
      Which boundless grace hath given:
    The hope, when time shall be no more,
      We all shall meet in heaven.

Prayer for the Success of the Gospel.


1   Great God, the nations of the earth
      Are by creation thine;
    And in thy works, by all beheld,
      Thy radiant glories shine.

2   But, Lord, thy greater love has sent
      Thy gospel to mankind,
    Unveiling what rich stores of grace
      Are treasured in thy mind.

3   O, when shall these glad tidings spread
      The spacious earth around,
    Till every tribe and every soul
      Shall hear the joyful sound?

4   Smile, Lord, on each divine attempt
      To spread the gospel's rays,
    And build on sin's demolished throne
      The temples of thy praise.

Missionary Hymn.


1   From Greenland's icy mountains,
      From India's coral strand,--
    Where Afric's sunny fountains
      Roll down their golden sand,--
    From many an ancient river,
      From many a palmy plain,--
    They call us to deliver
      Their land from error's chain.

2   What though the spicy breezes
      Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle;
    Though every prospect pleases,
      And only man is vile;
    In vain with lavish kindness
      The gifts of God are strown;
    The heathen in his blindness
      Bows down to wood and stone.

3   Shall we, whose souls are lighted
      By wisdom from on high,
    Shall we to men benighted
      The lamp of life deny?
    Salvation! O, salvation!
      The joyful sound proclaim,
    Till each remotest nation
      Has learnt Messiah's name.

1   Go! ye messengers of God,
      Like the beams of morning, fly;
    Take the wonder-working rod,
      Wave the Banner-Cross on high!
    Where th' lofty minaret
      Gleams along the morning skies,
    Wave it till the crescent set,
      And the "Star of Jacob" rise.

2   Go! to many a tropic isle,
      In the bosom of the deep;
    Where the skies forever smile,
      And th' oppressed forever weep!
    O'er the negro's night of care
      Pour the living light of heaven;
    Chase away the fiend despair,
      Bid him hope to be forgiven!

3   When the golden gates of day
      Open on the palmy east,
    Wide the bleeding cross display,
      Spread the gospel's richest feast:
    Circumnavigate the ball,
      Visit every soil and sea;
    Preach the Cross of Christ to all--
      Jesus' love is full and free!

    Light thou their path with thine own star,
      Bright beaming from above.

2   Wide as their mighty rivers flow,
      Let thine own truth extend;
    Where prairies spread and forests grow,
      O Lord, thy gospel send.

3   Then will a mighty nation own
      A union firm and strong;--
    The sceptre of th' eternal throne
      Shall rule its councils long.

On Western Missions.


1   When, Lord, to this our western land,
    Led by thy providential hand,
      Our wandering fathers came,
    Their ancient homes, their friends in youth
    Sent forth the heralds of thy truth,
      To keep them in thy name.

2   Then, through our solitary coast,
    The desert features soon were lost;
      Thy temples there arose;
    Our shores, as culture made them fair,
    Were hallowed by thy rites, by prayer,
      And blossomed as the rose.

3   And O, may we repay this debt
    To regions solitary yet
      Within our spreading land!
    There brethren, from our common home,
    Still westward, like our fathers, roam,
      Still guided by thy hand.

4   Father, we own this debt of love;
    O, shed thy Spirit from above,
      To move each Christian breast,
    Till heralds shall thy truth proclaim,
    And temples rise, to fix thy name,
      Through all our boundless West!

Missionaries Encouraged.


1   Ye Christian heralds,--go, proclaim
    Salvation in Immanuel's name:
    To distant climes the tidings bear,
    And plant the rose of Sharon there.

2   He'll shield you with a wall of fire,
    With holy zeal your hearts inspire,
    Bid raging winds their fury cease,
    And calm the savage breast to peace.

3   And when our labors all are o'er,
    Then shall we meet to part no more,--
    Meet, with the ransomed throng to fail,
    And crown the Saviour Lord of all.

Prayer for Children.


1   God of mercy, hear our prayer
      For the children thou hast given;
    Let them all thy blessings share--
      Grace on earth and bliss in heaven.

2   In the morning of their days
      May their hearts be drawn to thee;
    Let them learn to lisp thy praise
      In their earliest infancy.

3   When we see their passions rise,
      Sinful habits unsubdued,
    Then to thee we lift our eyes,
      That their hearts may be renewed.

4   For this mercy, Lord, we cry;
      Bend thine ever-gracious ear;
    While on thee our souls rely,
      Hear our prayer--in mercy hear.

Early Religion.


1   By cool Siloam's shady rill
      How sweet the lily grows!
    How sweet the breath beneath the hill
      Of Sharon's dewy rose!

2   Lo, such the child whose early feet
      The paths of peace have trod;
    Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,
      Is upward drawn to God!

3   By cool Siloam's shady rill
      The lily must decay;
    The rose that blooms beneath the hill
      Must shortly fade away.

4   And soon, too soon, the wintry hour
      Of man's maturer age
    Will shake the soul with sorrow's power,
      And stormy passion's rage!

5   O Thou, who giv'st us life and breath,
      We seek thy grace alone,
    In childhood, manhood, age, and death;
      To keep us still thine own!

1   "Remember thy Creator"
      While youth's fair spring is bright,
    Before thy cares are greater,
      Before comes age's night;
    While yet the sun shines o'er thee,
      While stars the darkness cheer,
    While life is all before thee,
      Thy great Creator fear.

Early Piety.


1   When children give their hearts to God,
      'Tis pleasing in his eyes;
    A flower, when offered in the bud,
      Is no vain sacrifice.

2   It saves us from a thousand snares
      To mind religion young;
    Grace will preserve our following years,
      And make our virtues strong.

3   To thee, Almighty God, to thee
      May we our hearts resign;
    'Twill please us to look back and see,
      That our whole lives were thine.

    Ere age arrive, and trembling wait
      Its summons to the tomb;

2   Remember thy Creator, God;
      For him thy powers employ;
    Make him thy fear, thy love, thy hope,
      Thy confidence, thy joy.

3   He shall defend and guide thy course
      Through life's uncertain sea,
    Till thou art landed on the shore
      Of blessed eternity.

4   Then seek the Lord betimes, and choose
      The path of heavenly truth:
    The earth affords no lovelier sight
      Than a religious youth.

Permanence of Early Religious Impressions.


1   While yet the youthful spirit bears
      The image of its God within,
    And uneffaced that beauty wears
      So soon to be destroyed by sin;--

2   Then is the time for faith and love
      To take in charge their precious care,
    Teach the young eye to look above,
      Teach the young knee to bend in prayer.

3   The world will come with care and crime,
      And tempt too many a heart astray;
    Still the seed sown in early time
      Will not be wholly cast away.

4   The infant prayer, the infant hymn,
      Within the darkened soul will rise,
    When age's weary eye is dim,
      And the grave's shadow round us lies.

5   Lord, grant our hearts be so inclined,
      Thy work to seek, thy will to do;
    And while we teach the youthful mind,
      Our own be taught thy lessons too.

Importance of the Bible to the Young.


1   How shall the young secure their hearts,
      And guard their lives, from sin?
    Thy word the choicest rules imparts
      To keep the conscience clean.

2   'Tis, like the sun, a heavenly light,
      That guides us all the day,
    And, through the dangers of the night,
      A lamp to lead our way.

3   Thy precepts make us truly wise;
      We hate the sinner's road:
    We hate our own vain thoughts that rise,
      But love thy law, O God!

4   Thy word is everlasting truth:
      How pure is every page!
    That holy book shall guide our youth,
      And well support our age.

Youth and the Spring-time.


1     Sweet is the time of spring,
      When nature's charms appear;
    The birds with ceaseless pleasure sing,
      And hail the opening year:
      But sweeter far the spring
      Of wisdom and of grace,
    When children bless and praise their King,
      Who loves the youthful race.

2     Sweet is the dawn of day,
      When light just streaks the sky;
    When shades and darkness pass away,
      And morning's beams are nigh:
      But sweeter far the dawn
      Of piety in youth;
    When doubt and darkness are withdrawn,
      Before the light of truth.

3     Sweet is the early dew,
      Which gilds the mountain tops,
    And decks each plant and flower we view,
      With pearly, glittering drops;
      But sweeter far the scene
      On Zion's holy hill,
    When there the dew of youth is seen
      Its freshness to distil.

"Remember thy Creator."


1   In the glad morn of life, when youth
      With generous ardor glows,
    And shines in all the fairest charms
      That beauty can disclose;

2   Deep on thy soul,--before its powers
      Are yet by vice enslaved,--
    Be thy Creator's lofty name
      And character engraved.

3   For soon the shades of grief may cloud
      The sunshine of thy days;
    And cares and toils, an endless round,
      Encompass all thy ways.

4   True wisdom, early sought and gained,
      In age will give thee rest;
    O then, improve the morn of life,
      To make its evening blest!

Children's Prayer.


1   God of mercy and of wisdom,
      Hear thy children's lisping cry;
    Let thy presence, Lord, be with them,
      Teaching lessons from on high.

2   Here, beneath thy wing, we seat us,
      Up to heaven for wisdom look;
    Lord, in mercy deign to meet us,--
      Meet us in thy sacred book.

3   Since thy truth doth gild its pages,
      May that truth, Lord, make us free;
    On the Rock of endless ages
      Let our faith established be.

4   To our faith we'll add the graces,
      Virtue, knowledge, patience, love;
    When on earth we leave our places,
      Raise us all to seats above.

Sabbath School Hymn.


1   Suppliant, lo! thy children bend,
      Father, for thy blessing now;
    Thou canst teach us, guide, defend,--
      We are weak, almighty thou.

2   With the peace thy word imparts,
      Be the taught and teacher blest;
    In their lives and on their hearts,
      Father, be thy laws imprest.

3   Pour into each longing mind
      Light and knowledge from above:
    Charity for all mankind--
      Trusting faith, enduring love.

Opening of the School.


1   We have met in peace together
      In this house of God again;
    Constant friends have led us hither,
      Here to chant the solemn strain,
    Here to breathe our adoration,
      Here the Saviour's praise to sing:
    May the Spirit of salvation
      Come with healing in his wing.

2   We have met, and Time is flying;
      We shall part, and still his wing,
    Sweeping o'er the dead and dying,
      Will the changeful seasons bring:
    Let us, while our hearts are lightest,
      In our fresh and early years,
    Turn to Him whose smile is brightest,
      And whose grace will calm our fears.

3   He will aid us, should existence
      With its sorrows sting the breast;
    Gleaming in the onward distance,
      Faith will mark the land of rest:
    There, 'midst day-beams round him playing,
      We our Father's face shall see,
    And shall hear him gently saying,
      "Little children, come to me."

Youthful Example.


1   What if the little rain should say,
      So small a drop as I
    Can ne'er refresh these thirsty fields,
      I'll tarry in the sky?

2   What if a shining beam of noon
      Should in its fountain stay,
    Because its feeble light alone
      Cannot create a day?

3   Doth not each rain-drop help to form
      The cool, refreshing shower,
    And every ray of light to warm
      And beautify the flower?

4   Go thou, and strive to do thy share--
      One talent,--less than thine,--
    Improved with steady zeal and care,
      Would gain rewards divine.

Sabbath School Anniversary.


1   From year to year in love we meet;
      From year to year in peace we part;
    The tongues of children uttering sweet
      The thrilling joy of every heart.

2   But time rolls on; and, year by year,
      We change, grow up, or pass away;
    Not twice the same assembly here
      Have hailed the children's festal day.

3   Death, ere another year, may strike
      Some in our number marked to fall:
    Be young and old prepared alike;
      The warning is to each, to all.

4   Oft broke, our failing ranks renew;
      Send teachers, children, in our place,
    More humble, docile, faithful, true,
      More like thy Son, from race to race.

1   Father, once more let grateful praise
      And humble prayer to thee ascend;
    Thou Guide and Guardian of our ways,
      Our early and our only Friend.

2   Since every day and hour that's gone
      Has been with mercy richly crowned,
    Mercy, we know, shall still flow on,
      Forever sure as time rolls round.

3   Hear then the parting prayers we pour,
      And bind our hearts in love alone;
    And if we meet on earth no more,
      May we at last surround thy throne.

    Hear, as in youthful days
    To thee we humbly raise
    Songs of our grateful praise,
        Holy and high!

    Mercy, to sinners dear,
    Life, dying souls to cheer,

3   Thanks, that on hearts like ours
    Thy loving kindness showers
        Knowledge divine;
    O let its influence be
    Fruitful in works for thee,
    Causing in purity
        Our lives to shine.

4   Bless this our childhood band,
    And let us ever stand
        Truthful and strong;
    Christians in deed and love,

    Till we in worlds above
        Thy praise prolong!

1   When, his salvation bringing,
      To Zion Jesus came,
    The children all stood singing
      Hosanna to his name.
    Nor did their zeal offend him,
      But, as he rode along,
    He bade them still attend him,
      And smiled to hear their song.

2   And since the Lord retaineth
      His love for children still,
    Though now as king he reigneth
      On Zion's heavenly hill,
    We'll flock around his banner,
      Who sits upon the throne;
    And cry aloud, "Hosanna
      To David's royal Son."

3   For should we fail proclaiming
      Our great Redeemer's praise,
    The stones, our silence shaming,
      Might well hosanna raise.
    But shall we only render
      The tribute of our words?
    No! while our hearts are tender,
      They, too, shall be the Lord's.

Anniversary of Independence.


1   We come with joy and gladness
      To breathe our songs of praise,
    Nor let one note of sadness
      Be mingled in our lays;
    For 'tis a hallowed story,
      This theme of freedom's birth:
    Our fathers' deeds of glory
      Are echoed round the earth.

2   The sound is waxing stronger,
      And thrones and nations hear--
    Proud men shall rule no longer,
      For God the Lord is near:
    And he will crush oppression,
      And raise the humble mind,
    And give the earth's possession
      Among the good and kind.

3   And then shall sink the mountains
      Where pride and power are crowned,
    And peace, like gentle fountains,
      Shall shed its pureness round.
    O God! we would adore thee,
      And in thy shadow rest;
    Our fathers bowed before thee,
      And trusted and were blest.

Autumn Warnings.


1   See the leaves around us falling,
      Dry and withered, to the ground;
    Thus to thoughtless mortals calling,
      In a sad and solemn sound:--

2   "Youth, on length of days presuming,
      Who the paths of pleasure tread,--
    View us, late in beauty blooming,
      Numbered now among the dead.

3   "What though yet no losses grieve you,
      Gay with health and many a grace,
    Let not cloudless skies deceive you:
      Summer gives to autumn place."

4   On the tree of life eternal,
      Let our highest hopes be staid:
    This alone, forever vernal,
      Bears a leaf that shall not fade.

Death of a Teacher.


1   Farewell, dear friend! a long farewell!

    Till we are raised with thee to dwell
      On Zion's happy shore.

2   Our friend and brother, lo! is dead!
      The cold and lifeless clay
    Has made in dust its silent bed,
      And there it must decay.

3   Farewell, dear friend, again farewell,--
      Soon we shall rise to thee;
    And when we meet, no tongue can tell
      How great our joys shall be.

4   No more we'll mourn thee, parted friend,
      But lift our ardent prayer,
    And every thought and effort bend
      To rise and join thee there.

2   Thy heart, while on earth, in his praises delighted,
      Thy voice ever spoke of his fatherly love;
    And now, by life's shadows no longer benighted,
      Thou wilt love him and praise him in heaven above.

3   And there may we meet when life shall be ended,
      All tears wiped away, and all errors forgiven,
    And there may our prayers together be blended
      In the sweet song of praise to our Master in heaven.

Death of a Scholar.


1   We come our Sabbath hymn to raise,
      Our earnest, humble prayer to pour;
    One voice is hushed, its notes of praise
      Shall mingle here with ours no more.

2   The lips are still, the eye is dim,
      That brightly beamed with joy and love;
    The spirit, it hath gone to Him
      Who freely gave it from above.

3   We will not weep, for Jesus said,

1   One sweet flower has drooped and faded,
      One sweet infant's voice has fled,
    One fair brow the grave has shaded,
      One dear school-mate now is dead.

      For our friend is happy now;
    She has knelt in soul-felt gladness,
      Where the blessed angels bow.

3   She has gone to heaven before us,
      But she turns and waves her hand,
    Pointing to the glories o'er us,
      In that happy spirit-land.

      Keep us all from danger free;
    Do thou guard, and guide, and love us,
      Till like her we go to thee.

2   A little sparrow cannot fall
      Unnoticed, Lord, by thee;
    And though I am so young and small,
      Thou dost take care of me.

      To serve thee while I live.

3   Art thou my Father?--I'll depend
    Upon the care of such a friend;

    Send down and take me, in thy love,

Acceptable Offering.

      Wise, beneficent, and kind!
    Spread o'er nature's ample face,
      Flows thy goodness unconfined.
    Musing in the silent grove,
      Or the busy walks of men,
    Still we trace thy wondrous love,
      Claiming large returns again.

2   Lord, what offering shall we bring,
      At thine altars when we bow?
    Hearts, the pure unsullied spring
      Whence the kind affections flow;
    Soft compassion's feeling soul,
      By the melting eye expressed;
    Sympathy, at whose control
      Sorrow leaves the wounded breast;

3   Willing hands to lead the blind,
      Bind the wounded, feed the poor;
    Love, embracing all our kind;
      Charity, with liberal store:--
    Teach us, O thou heavenly King,
      Thus to show our grateful mind,
    Thus the accepted offering bring,
      Love to thee and all mankind.

      With blessings on his seed.

3   In times of danger and distress,
      Some beams of light shall shine,
    To show the world his righteousness,
      And give him peace divine.

4   His works of piety and love
      Remain before the Lord;
    Sweet peace on earth, and joys above,
      Shall be his sure reward.

All Men are equal.


1   All men are equal in their birth,

    All men are equal when that earth
      Fades from their dying eyes.

2   God meets the throngs who pay their vows
      In courts that hands have made,
    And hears the worshipper who bows
      Beneath the plantain shade.

3   'Tis man alone who difference sees,
      And speaks of high and low,
    And worships those, and tramples these,
      While the same path they go.

4   O, let man hasten to restore
      To all their rights of love;
    In power and wealth exult no more;
      In wisdom lowly move.

5   Ye great, renounce your earth-born pride,
      Ye low, your shame and fear:
    Live, as ye worship, side by side;
      Your brotherhood revere.

    And on the cheek where sickness preys,
      Bid health to plant the rose.

2   Go where the friendless stranger lies;
      To perish is his doom:
    Snatch from the grave his closing eyes.
      And bring his blessing home.

3   Thus what our Heavenly Father gave
      Shall we as freely give;
    Thus copy him who lived to save,
      And died that we might live.

      Your strong compassion glows;

    Exile and chains to you are dear,

All Things vain without Love.


1   Had I the tongues of Greeks and Jews,
    And nobler speech than angels use,
    If love be absent, I am found
    Like tinkling brass, an empty sound.

2   Were I inspired to preach and tell
    All that is done in heaven and hell;
    Or could my faith the world remove,
    Still I am nothing without love.

3   Should I distribute all my store
    To feed the cravings of the poor;
    Or give my body to the flame
    To gain a martyr's glorious name;

4   If love to God and love to men
    Be absent, all my hopes are vain:
    Nor tongues, nor gifts, nor fiery zeal,
    The works of love can e'er fulfil.

1   All hail! ye servants of the Lord!
      On mercy's mission bound;
    Who, like the sower of the word,
      Strew precious gifts around.

2   What though your seed 'mid thorns be sown,
      Where tares and brambles thrive,
    Still One is able, One alone,
      To save its germ alive.

3   Ye fear, what falls on stony earth
      Will mock your prayerful toil;
    But sometimes plants of holiest birth
      Bear fruit in sterile soil.

4   The seed that by the way-side fell,
      Perchance you counted dead;
    Yet birds, that sing in heaven, may tell,
      They on its sweetness fed.

5   And some a hundred fold shall bear,
      To glorify the Lord;
    How blessed, then, will be your care!
      How glorious your reward!

      Then the cheering sun will shine,
    So shall plenteous fruit be given,
      Through an influence all divine.

2   Sow thy seed, be never weary,
      Let not fear thy mind employ;
    Though the prospect be most dreary,
      Thou may'st reap the fruits of joy:
    Lo! the scene of verdure bright'ning,

2     And duly shall appear,
      In verdure, beauty, strength,
    The tender blade, the stalk, the ear,
      And the full corn at length.

3     Thou canst not toil in vain;
      Cold, heat, and moist, and dry,
    Shall foster and mature the grain
      For garners in the sky.

Faith without Works is Dead.


1   As body when the soul has fled,
    As barren trees, decayed and dead,

    If not of righteous deeds the spring.

2   One cup of healing oil and wine,
    One tear-drop shed on mercy's shrine,
    Is thrice more grateful, Lord, to thee,
    Than lifted eye or bended knee.

Christian Beneficence.


1   Hail, love divine! joys ever new,
    While thy kind dictates we pursue,
      Our souls delighted share,
    Too high for sordid minds to know,
    Who on themselves alone bestow
      Their wishes and their care.

2   By thee inspired, the generous breast,
    In blessing others only blest,
      With kindness large and free,
    Delights the widow's tears to stay,
    To teach the blind their smoothest way,
      And aid the feeble knee.

3   O God, with sympathetic care,
    In others' joys and griefs to share,
      Do thou our hearts incline;
    Each low, each selfish wish control,
    Warm with benevolence the soul,
      And make us wholly thine.

Liberality Rewarded.  Ps. 112.

    Who lends the poor without reward,
      Or gives with liberal hands.

2   As pity dwells within his breast
      To all the sons of need,
    So God shall answer his request
      With blessings on his seed.

3   No evil tidings shall surprise
      His well-established mind;
    His soul to God, his refuge, flies,
      And leaves his fears behind.

4   In times of general distress,
      Some beams of light shall shine
    To show the world his righteousness,
      And give him peace divine.

Love and Charity.


1   Let Pharisees of high esteem
      Their faith and zeal declare,--
    All their religion is a dream,
      If love be wanting there.

2   Love suffers long with patient eye,
      Nor is provoked in haste;
    She lets the present injury die,
      And long forgets the past.

3   Malice and rage, those fires of hell,
      She quenches with her tongue;
    Hopes and believes, and thinks no ill,
      Though she endures the wrong.

4   Love is the grace that keeps her power
      In all the realms above;
    There faith and hope are known no more,
      But saints forever love.

Anniversary of a Charitable Association.


1   When long the soul had slept in chains,
      And man to man was stern and cold;
    When love and worship were but strains
      That swept the gifted chords of old--
    By shady mount and peaceful lake,
      meek and lowly stranger came,
    The weary drank the words he spake,
      The poor and feeble blessed his name.

2   No shrine he reared in porch or grove,
      No vested priests around him stood--
    He went about to teach, and prove
      The lofty work of doing good.
    Said he, to those who with him trod,
      "Would ye be my disciples? Then
    Evince your ardent love for God
      By the kind deeds ye do for men."

3   He went where frenzy held its rule,
      Where sickness breathed its spell of pain;
    By famed Bethesda's mystic pool;
      And by the darkened gate of Nain.
    He soothed the mourner's troubled breast,
      He raised the contrite, sinner's head,
    And on the loved ones' lowly rest,
      The light of better life he shed.

4   Father, the spirit Jesus knew,
      We humbly ask of thee to-night,
    That we may be disciples too
      Of him whose way was love and light.
    Bright be the places where we tread
      Amid earth's suffering and its poor,
    Till we shall come where tears are shed
      And broken sighs are heard no more.

Imitation of Christ's Kindness.


1   Lord, lead the way the Saviour went
      By lane and cell obscure,
    And let our treasures still be spent,
      Like his, upon the poor.

2   Like him, through scenes of deep distress,
      Who bore the world's sad weight,
    We, in their gloomy loneliness,
      Would seek the desolate.

3   For thou hast placed us side by side
      In this wide world of ill;
    And that thy followers may be tried,
      The poor are with us still.

4   Small are the offerings we can make;
      Yet thou hast taught us, Lord,
    If given for the Saviour's sake,
      They lose not their reward.

      Hast power to aid or bless;
    Whose aching heart or burning brow
      Thy soothing hand may press.

2   Thy neighbor? 'tis the fainting poor,
      Whose eye with want is dim;
    O enter thou his humble door,
      With aid and peace for him.

3   Thy neighbor? he who drinks the cup
      When sorrow drowns the brim;
    With words of high sustaining hope,
      Go thou and comfort him.

4   Thy neighbor? 'tis the weary slave,
      Fettered in mind and limb;
    He hath no hope this side the grave;
      Go thou, and ransom him.

5   Thy neighbor? pass no mourner by;
      Perhaps thou canst redeem
    A breaking heart from misery;
      Go, share thy lot with him.

The Blessedness of considering the Poor.  Ps. 41:1-3.


1   Blest who with generous pity glows,
    Who learns to feel another's woes;
    Bows to the poor man's wants his ear,
    And wipes the helpless orphan's tear!
    In every want, in every woe,
    Himself thy pity, Lord, shall know.

2   Thy love his life shall guard, thy hand
    Give to his lot the chosen land;
    Nor leave him, in the troubled day,
    To unrelenting foes a prey.
    In sickness thou shall raise his head,
    And make with tenderest care his bed.

      Is sought by want's imploring cry,--
    Whose bounty and whose grace are near,
      Thy needy children to supply:--

2   To whom with more acceptance rise
      The words of mercy's voice divine,
    Than pompous rites, or sacrifice
      Of flocks and herds, of oil and wine.

3   Where'er the poor our aid demand,
      Teach us with ready steps to move,
    Give us the zealous heart and hand
      To do the work of Christian love;--

4   The downcast spirit to revive,
      The fainting heart with joy to bless;
    To bid the solitary live--
      The widow and the fatherless.

5   Thus will we thank thee that thy grace
      Inclined our feet in paths to go
    Where shines that brightness of thy face,
      Which the obedient only know.

2   The poor are thy peculiar care;
      To them thy promises are sure:
    Thy gifts the poor in spirit share;
      O, may we always thus be poor.

3   May we thy law of love fulfil,
      To bear each other's burdens here,
    Endure and do thy righteous will,
      And walk in all thy faith and fear.

    From our abundance to impart
      A liberal portion to the poor.

    Freely we have received from thee;

1   How blest, amid all blessing
      This changing world bestows,
    That soul in truth possessing
      Pity for others' woes;
    Ready to move and lighten
      The load affliction bears--
    Want's face with joy to brighten,
      In deed, as with its prayers.

2   Thus Christ, the Friend and Servant
      Of man, depressed and poor--
    With ready soul and fervent--
      With patience to endure--
    Lived, labored without measure
      In mercy's holy name,
    God's will his highest pleasure,
      Our good his only fame.

3   And those who in his spirit
      Would seek to live and move,
    His virtue must inherit,
      And labor in his love;
    Labor where poor, forsaken,
      And lowly, sufferers lie;
    In faith and hope unshaken;
      Celestial ministry!

4   God of all times and stations!
      Teach us this lesson true,--
    Proclaim it to all nations
      In life and power anew,--

    Glad offering Mercy raises,
      By living deeds sustained!

      For all the grace we see?
    The goodness feeble man can yield
      Extendeth not to thee.

2   To scenes of woe, to beds of pain,
      We'll cheerfully repair,
    And, with the gifts thy hand bestows,
      Relieve the sufferers there.

3   The widow's heart shall sing for joy;
      The orphan shall be glad;
    And hungering souls we'll gladly point
      To Christ, the living bread.

4   Thus what our heavenly Father gave
      Shall we as freely give;
    Thus copy him who lived to save,
      And died that we might live.

2   Make us thy messengers to shed
      Within the home of want and woe,
    The blessings of thy bounty, spread
      So freely on thy world below.

3   Let us go forth with joyful hand
      To strengthen, comfort and relieve;
    Then in thy presence may we stand,
      And hope thy blessing to receive.

1   When, like a stranger on our sphere,
    The lowly Jesus wandered here,
    Where'er he went, affliction fled.
    And sickness reared her fainting head.

2   Demoniac madness, dark and wild,
    In his inspiring presence smiled;
    The storm of horror ceased to roll,
    And reason lightened through the soul.

3   Through paths of loving-kindness led,
    Where Jesus triumphed, we would tread;
    To all, with willing hands, dispense
    The crumbs of our benevolence.

4   Here the whole family of woe
    Shall friends, and home, and comfort know;
    The blasted form and shipwrecked mind
    Shall here a tranquil haven find.

5   And Thou, dread Power, whose sovereign breath
    Is health or sickness, life or death,
    This favored mansion deign to bless;
    The cause is thine--send thou success!

2   We are a stricken, humble band,
      With hearts that thrill to words of love,
    And cling confiding to the hand
      That points us to a home above.

3   Though 'mong the lowly of the earth,
      Contented with our homely fare,
    How cheerful was the orphan's hearth
      Before cold Death had entered there

4   No mother's voice soothes us to rest--
      No father's smile our vision greets:
    Yet we've a home in every breast
      That with a tender feeling beats.

5   And thou hast raised us many a friend,
      Not bound by ties of kindred blood;
    Then let our hearts in prayer ascend
      To thee, our Father--Saviour--God!

1   We praise thee, if one rescued soul,

    Turned, shuddering, from the poisonous bowl,
      To health, and liberty, and light.

2   We praise thee, if one clouded home,
      Where broken hearts despairing pined,
    Beheld the sire and husband come
      Erect and in his perfect mind.

3   No more a weeping wife to mock,
      Till all her hopes in anguish end;
    No more the trembling child to shock,
      And sink the father in the fiend.

4   Still give us grace, almighty King!
      Unwavering at our posts to stand,
    Till grateful to thy shrine we bring

      Redeemed from error's chain,

3     Ours is no conquest gained
      Upon the tented field;
    Nor hath the flowing life-blood stained

4     But the strong might of love,
      And truth's all-pleading voice,
    As angels bending from above,
      Have made our hearts rejoice.

    The might, the strength, are thine alone!

      Our spirits trust for strength divine;
    Gird us with heaven's own energy,

    What countless thousands tribute bring,

3   Thou wilt not break the bruised reed,
      Nor leave the broken heart unbound:
    The wife regains a husband freed!
      The orphan clasps a father found!

4   Spare, Lord, the thoughtless; guide the blind,

    To live, by forging chains to bind
      His weaker brother in the dust.

      Bind us in the bonds of peace.

3   Pity, O God, the heedless wretch,
      Who staggers to a dreadful grave;
    Thy arm of love around him stretch,
      And show that thou art strong to save.

    Scorched the green earth like lava-flame,
      And every plant of mercy slew.

2   From clime to clime its branches spread
      Their fearful fruits of sin and woe;
    The prince of darkness loved its shade,
      And toiled its fiery seeds to sow.

3   Faith poured her prayer at midnight hour;
      The hand of zeal at noon-day wrought;
    An armor of celestial power
      The children of the cross besought.

4   Behold the axe its pride doth wound;
      Through its cleft boughs the sun doth shine;
    Its blasted blossoms strew the ground:
      Give glory to the arm divine.

5   And still Jehovah's aid implore,
      From isle to isle, from sea to sea,
    From peopled earth's remotest shore,
      To root that deadly Upas Tree.

          By Christians wrought?
    Those who these chains have worn,
    Christians from home have torn,
    Christians have hither borne,
          Christians have bought!

    From thine own image cast
          Away all cords,
    Save those of love, which brings
    Man, from his long wand'rings,
    Back--to the King of kings,--

3   From the grasp of strong oppression,

    Will regard the captive's prayer,
      Will from bondage set him free.

4   From the tyranny within,
      Save thy children, Lord! we pray;
    Chains of iron, chains of sin,
      Cast forever, cast away.

5   Love to man, and love to God,
      Are the weapons of our war;
    These can break the oppressor's rod--
      Burst the bonds that we abhor.




803.              L. M.            J. G. Whittier.

For a Liberty Meeting on the Fourth of July.


1   O Thou! whose presence went before
      Our fathers in their weary way,
    As with thy chosen moved of yore
      The fire by night--the cloud by day!

2   When, from each temple of the free,
      A nation's song ascends to heaven,
    Most Holy Father! unto thee,
      May not our humble prayer be given,--

3   For those to whom this day can bring,
      Not, as to us, the joyful thrill;--
    For those, who, under freedom's wing,
      Are bound in slavery's fetters still:--

4   And grant, O Father! that the time
      Of Earth's deliverance may be near,
    When every land, and tongue, and clime,
      The message of thy love shall hear.

5   When smitten, as with fire from heaven,
      The captive's chain shall sink in dust,
    And to his fettered soul be given
      The glorious freedom of the just.




804.              L. M.               Miss Weston.

"'Tis good to be merciful."


1   'Tis good to weep and mourn for those,
      Crushed down by Slavery's iron hand,
    And feel, while numbering o'er their woes,
      Strength for the just and true to stand.

2   'Tis good and true to say to those,
      Who claim a right in human kind,
    "Mercy and Justice are your foes,
      And they shall certain triumph find."

3   'Tis good--'tis blessed, to say to all,
      "Arise, to help the wretched slave,
    Upon your God for courage call,
      And in his strength go forth and save."

4   Lord! this is what we seek to do;
      Grant us thy grace to do it well;
    Help us thy glory to pursue,
      And of thy promises to tell.




805.              P. M.               H. Ware, Jr.

The Progress of Freedom.


1   Oppression shall not always reign;
      There comes a brighter day;
    When freedom, burst from every chain,
      Shall have triumphant way.
    Then right shall over might prevail,
    And truth, like hero armed in mail,
    The hosts of tyrant wrong assail,
      And hold eternal sway.

2   What voice shall bid the progress stay
      Of truth's victorious car?
    What arm arrest the growing day,
      Or quench the solar star?
    What reckless soul, though stout and strong,
    Shall dare bring back the ancient wrong,
    Oppression's guilty night prolong,
      And freedom's morning bar?

3   The hour of triumph comes apace,
      The fated, promised hour,
    When earth upon a ransomed race
      Her bounteous gifts shall shower.
    Ring, Liberty, thy glorious bell!
    Bid high thy sacred banner swell!
    Let trump on trump the triumph tell
      Of Heaven's redeeming power.




806.          6s. & 10s. M. Milton, Gardner,  and Dwight.

Peace.


1       No war nor battle's sound
        Was heard the earth around,--
    No hostile chiefs to furious combat ran;
        But peaceful was the night
        In which the Prince of Light
    His reign of peace upon the earth began.

2       No conqueror's sword he bore,
        Nor warlike armor wore,
    Nor haughty passions roused to contest wild;
        In peace and love he came,
        And gentle was the reign,
    Which o'er the earth he spread by influence mild.

3       Unwilling kings obeyed,
        And sheathed the battle blade,
    And called their bloody legions from the field;
        In silent awe they wait,
        And close the warrior's gate,
    Nor know to whom their homage thus they yield.

4       The peaceful conqueror goes,
        And triumphs o'er his foes,
    His weapons drawn from armories above;
        Behold the vanquished sit
        Submissive at his feet,
    And strife and hate are changed to peace and love.




807.          6s. & 4s. M.               E. Davis.

For an Anniversary Meeting of the Friends of Peace.


1   Not with the flashing steel--
    Not with the cannon's peal,
        Or stir of drum,
    But in the bonds of love;
    Our white flag floats above,
    Her emblem is the dove,
        'Tis thus we come.

2   The laws of Christian light,
    These are our weapons bright,
        Our mighty shield;
    Christ is our leader high,
    And the broad plains which lie
    Beneath the blesséd sky,
        Our battle field.

3   On, then, in God's great name,
    Let each pure spirit's flame
        Burn bright and clear:
    Stand firmly in your lot,
    Cry ye aloud, "Doubt not,"
    Be every fear forgot,
        Christ leads us here.

4   So shall Earth's distant lands
    In happy, holy bands,
        One brotherhood,
    Together rise and sing,
    And joyful offerings bring,
    And Heaven's Eternal King
        Pronounce it _good_.




808.              C. M.                   Gibbons.

Prayer for Universal Peace.


1   Lord, send thy word, and let it run,
      Armed with thy Spirit's power;
    Ten thousand shall confess its sway,
      And bless the saving hour.

2   Beneath the influence of thy grace
      The barren wastes shall rise,
    With sudden greens and fruits arrayed,
      A blooming paradise.

3   True holiness shall strike its root
      In each regenerate heart,
    Shall in a growth divine arise,
      And heavenly fruits impart.

4   Peace, with her olives crowned, shall stretch
      Her wings from shore to shore;
    No trump shall rouse the rage of war,
      Nor murderous cannon roar.

5   Lord, for those days we wait;--those days
      Are in thy word foretold;
    Fly swifter, sun and stars, and bring
      This promised age of gold!

The Gospel of Peace.


1   Joy to the earth! the Prince of Peace
      His banner has unfurled;
    Let strife, and sin, and error cease,
      And joy pervade the world!

2   Praise ye the Lord! for truth and grace
      His word and life display;
    Let every soul his love embrace,
      And own its gentle sway.

3   Peace on the earth, good will to men,
      Embraced the Gospel plan;
    Let that sweet strain be heard again,
      Which angel-tones began.

4   Joy to the isles and lands afar,
      Messiah reigns above;
    Let every eye behold the star,
      The star of light and love.




810.              C. M.            Mrs. Livermore.

Peace.


1   No warlike sounds awoke the night,
      Announcing Jesus' birth,
    But angels borne on wings of light,
      Who chanted "Peace to earth!"

2   Not in the warrior's armor mailed
      Was Christ the Saviour found;
    Not striving, when by wrath assailed
      Not with the laurel crowned.

3   But meek and lowly was his life,
      The gentle Prince of Peace,
    Whose law condemns the hostile strife,
      And bids dissensions cease.

4   Then let the war-cry ne'er be rung
      Beneath the smiling sky,
    Nor to the clouds the banner flung
      That tells of victory.

5   But let the blissful period haste,
      When, hushed the cannon's roar,
    The sword shall cease mankind to waste,
      And war shall be no more.

Prospect of Universal Peace.


1   O'er mountain tops, the mount of God,
      In latter days, shall rise
    Above the summits of the hills,
      And draw the wondering eyes.

2   The beams that shine from Zion's hill
      Shall lighten every land;
    The King who reigns in Salem's towers
      Shall the whole world command.

3   Nor war shall rage, nor hostile strife
      Disturb those happy years;
    To ploughshares men shall beat their swords,
      To pruning-hooks their spears.

4   No longer host, encountering host,
      Shall crowds of slain deplore;
    They'll lay the martial trumpet by,
      And study war no more.

The Blessings of Peace.


1   Peace! the welcome sound proclaim,
    Dwell with rapture on the theme;
    Loud, still louder, swell the strain:
    Peace on earth, good will to men.

2   Breezes! whispering soft and low,
    Gently murmur as ye blow,
    Breathe the sweet celestial strain,
    Peace on earth, good will to men.

3   Ocean's billows! far and wide
    Rolling in majestic pride:
    Loud still louder, swell the strain,
    Peace on earth, good will to men.

4   Christians! who these blessings feel,
    And in adoration kneel;
    Loud, still louder, swell the strain,
    Praise to God, good will to men.




813.        8s. 7s. & 6s. M.        Miss Fletcher.

Compassion for the Sinning.


1   Think gently of the erring!
      Lord, let us not forget,
    However darkly stained by sin,
      He is our brother yet.
    Heir of the same inheritance!
      Child of the self-same God!
    He hath but stumbled in the path,
      We have in weakness trod.

2   Speak gently to him, brother;
      Thou yet mayst lead him back,
    With holy words, and tones of love,
      From misery's thorny track.
    Forget not thou hast often sinned,
      And sinful yet must be:
    Deal gently with the erring one,
      As God hath dealt with thee.




814.             10s. M.                Anonymous.

The Same.


1   Breathe thoughts of pity o'er a brother's fall,
      But dwell not with stern anger on his fault;
    The grace of God alone holds thee, holds all;
      Were that withdrawn, thou, too, wouldst swerve and halt.

2   Send back the wand'rer to the Saviour's fold;
      That were an action worthy of a saint;
    But not in malice let the crime be told,
      Nor publish to the world the evil taint.

3   The Saviour suffers when his children slide;
      Then is his holy name by men blasphemed
    And he afresh is mocked and crucified,
      Even by those his bitter death redeemed.

4   Rebuke the sin, and yet in love rebuke;
      Feel as one member in another's pain;
    Win back the soul that his fair path forsook,
      And mighty and rejoicing is thy gain!




815.              L. M.            Mrs. Livermore.

Reclaiming Power of Love.


1   Jesus, what precept is like thine,
      "Forgive, as ye would be forgiven!"
    If heeded, O what power divine
      Would then transform our earth to heaven.

2   Not by the harsh or scornful word,
      Should we our brother seek to gain,
    Not by the prison or the sword,
      The shackle, or the clanking chain.

3   But from our spirits there must flow
      A love that will his wrong outweigh;
    Our lips must only blessings know,
      And wrath and sin shall die away.

4   'Twas heaven that formed the holy plan
      To bring the wanderer back by love;
    Thus let us win our brother, man,
      And imitate thee, God above!




816.              L. M.             Miss Fletcher.

For the Prisoner.


1   Father! we pray for those who dwell
    Within the prison's gloomy cell!
    For those whose souls are bending low
    Beneath the weight of guilt and woe.

2   Thy love hath kept our thorny way
    And saved us from sin's iron sway;
    Our brethren in a weaker hour
    Have yielded to temptation's power.

3   Teach us with humble hearts to feel,
    How darkly on our brows the seal
    Of guilt might now perchance be set,
    Had we the same temptation met.

4   Then while the error we would shun,
    We still would aid the erring one
    To turn from sin's unpitying sway,
    To virtue's fair and pleasant way.




817.              L. M.             Miss Edgarton.

The Same.


1   Oh shut not out sweet Pity's ray
      From souls now clouded o'er by sin;
    Touch their deep springs, and let the day
      Of Christian love flow freely in.

2   Send them kind missions, though their feet
      No more again the world may tread;
    Some pulse of better life may beat
      In hearts that seem unmoved and dead.

3   'Tis just that they should bear the pain
      Of keen remorse and guilty shame;
    But scorn may drive to crime again--
      'Tis only love that can reclaim.




818.              S. M.             Miss Fletcher.

The Same.


1     We come to thee, O God,
      With hushed and solemn strain;
    We come to plead for those who lie
      Bound with the prisoner's chain.

2     O, give them contrite hearts,
      To feel their fearful sin,
    And give to us a patient faith
      Those erring ones to win.

3     Give us to love thy law,
      The paths of vice to shun,
    But never harshly dare to spurn
      The suffering sinful one.

The Coming of Christ in Power.


1     Lord Jesus, come; for here
      Our path through wilds is laid!
    We watch as for the day-spring near,
      Amid the breaking shade.

2     Lord Jesus, come; for hosts
      Meet on the battle plain:
    The patriot mourns, the tyrant boasts,
      And tears are shed like rain.

3     Lord Jesus, come; for chains
      Are still upon the slave;
    Bind up his wounds, relieve his pains,
      The pining bondman save.

4     Hark! herald voices near,
      Lead on thy happier day:
    Come, Lord, and our hosannas hear;
      We wait to strew thy way.

5     Come, as in days of old,
      With words of grace and power;
    Gather us all within thy fold,
      And let us stray no more.




820.              C. M.                 R. Nicoll.

Honor all Men.


1   I may not scorn the meanest thing
      That on the earth doth crawl;
    The slave who would not burst his chain,
      The tyrant in his hall.

2   The vile oppressor who hath made
      The widowed mother mourn,
    Though worthless, soulless he may stand,
      I cannot, dare not scorn.

3   The darkest night that shrouds the sky,
      Of beauty hath a share:
    The blackest heart hath sighs to tell
      That God still lingers there.




821.              C. M.                  Whittier.

The Call of Truth.


1   Oh! not alone with outward sign,
      Of fear, or voice from heaven,
    The message of a truth divine,
      The call of God, is given;
    Awakening in the human heart,
      Love for the true and right,
    Zeal for the Christian's better part,
      Strength for the Christian's fight.

2   Though heralded by nought of fear,
      Or outward sign or show;
    Though only to the inward ear
      It whisper soft and low;
    Though dropping as the manna fell,
      Unseen, yet from above,
    Holy and gentle, heed it well:
      The call to truth and love.




822.              C. M.            Lond. Inquirer.

Encouragement to Christian Effort.


1   Scorn not the slightest word or deed,
      Nor deem it void of power;
    There's fruit in each wind-wafted seed,
      Waiting its natal hour.

2   A whispered word may touch the heart,
      And call it back to life;
    A look of love bid sin depart,
      And still unholy strife.

3   No act falls fruitless; none can tell
      How vast its power may be;
    Nor what results enfolded dwell
      Within it silently.

4   Work and despair not: bring thy mite,
      Nor care how small it be;
    God is with all that serve the right,
      The holy, true, and free.




823.              S. M.                   Enfield.

Forgiveness.


1     I hear the voice of woe!
      I hear a brother's sigh!
    Then let my heart with pity flow,
      With tears of love, my eye.

2     I hear the thirsty cry!
      The hungry beg for bread!
    Then let my spring its stream supply,
      My hand its bounty shed.

3     The debtor humbly sues,
      Who would, but cannot pay;
    And shall I lenity refuse,
      Who need it every day?

4     And shall not wrath relent,
      Touched by that humble strain,
    My brother crying, "I repent,
      Nor will offend again?"

5     How else, on soaring wing,
      Can hope bear high my prayer,
    Up to thy throne, my God, my King,
      To plead for pardon there?




824.             7s. M.                    Milman.

"And he arose and rebuked the winds and sea."


1   Lord! thou didst arise and say,
      To the troubled waters, "Peace,"
    And the tempest died away,
      Down they sank, the foaming seas;
    And a calm and heaving sleep
      Spread o'er all the glassy deep,
    All the azure lake serene
      Like another heaven was seen!

2   Lord! thy gracious word repeat
      To the billows of the proud!
    Quell the tyrant's martial heat,
      Quell the fierce and changing crowd!
    Then the earth shall find repose,
      From oppressions, and from woes;
    And another heaven appear
      On our world of darkness here!

"They that go down to the sea in ships."


1   Lord of the wide extended main!
      Whose power the winds and seas controls,
    Whose hand doth earth and heaven sustain,
      Whose spirit leads believing souls;

2   Throughout the deep thy footsteps shine;
      We own thy way is in the sea,
    O'erawed by majesty divine,
      And lost in thine immensity!

3   Infinite God! thy greatness spanned
      These heavens, and meted out the skies;
    Lo' in the hollow of thy hand
      The measured waters sink and rise.

4   Thee to perfection who can tell?
      Earth and her sons beneath thee lie,
    Lighter than dust within thy scale,
      And less than nothing in thine eye.

The Seaman's Song.


1   Would you behold the works of God,
    His wonders in the world abroad?
    With hardy mariners survey
    The unknown regions of the sea.

2   They leave their native shores behind,
    And seize the favor of the wind;
    Till God command, and tempests rise,
    That heave the ocean to the skies.

3   When land is far, and death is nigh,
    Bereaved of hope, to God they cry:
    His mercy hears their loud address,
    And sends salvation in distress.

4   He bids the winds their wrath assuage,
    And stormy tempests cease to rage;
    The grateful band their fears give o'er
    And hail with joy their native shore.

5   O, may the sons of men record
    The wondrous goodness of the Lord;
    Let them their purest offerings bring,
    And in the church his glory sing.

1   Oh God! thy name they well may praise,
      Who to the deep go down,
    And trace the wonders of thy ways,
      Where rocks and billows frown.

2   For many a fair majestic sight
      Hath met their wandering eyes,
    Beneath the streaming northern light
      Or blaze of Indian skies.

3   If glorious be that awful deep,
      No human power can bind,
    What then art thou, who bid'st it keep
      Within its bounds confined!

4   Let heaven and earth in praise unite,
      Eternal praise to thee,
    Whose word can rouse the tempest's might,
      Or still the raging sea!

The Mariner's Hymn.


1   Lord of the sea!--thy potent sway
    Old ocean's wildest waves obey;
    The gale that whistles through the shrouds,
    The storm that drives the frighted clouds,--
    If but thy whisper order peace,
    How soon their rude commotions cease!

2   Lord of the sea!--the seaman keep
    From all dangers of the deep!
    When high the white-capped billows rise,
    When tempests roar along the skies,
    When foes or shoals awaken fear,--
    O, in thy mercy be thou near.

3   Lord of the sea!--a sea is life
    Of care and sorrow, woe and strife!
    With watchful pains we steer along,
    To keep the right path, shun the wrong:
    God grant, that, when we cease to roam,
    We gain an everlasting home!

1   When the parting bosom bleeds,
    When our native shore recedes,
    When the wild and faithless main
    Takes us to her trust again,
    Father! view a sailor's woe--
    Guide us wheresoe'er we go.

2   When the lonely watch we keep,
    Silent on the mighty deep,
    While the boisterous surges hoarse
    Bear us daily on our course,
    Eye that never slumbers! shed
    Holy influence on our head.

3   When the Sabbath's peaceful ray,
    O'er the ocean's breast doth play,
    Though no throngs assemble there,
    No sweet church-bell warns to prayer,
    Spirit! let thy presence be
    Sabbath to the unresting sea.

4   When in foreign lands we roam,
    Far from kindred, far from home,
    Stranger-eyes our conduct view,
    Heathen-bands our steps pursue,
    Let our conversation be
    Fitting those who follow thee.

5   Should pale death, with arrow dread,
    Make the ocean-cave our bed,
    Though no eye of love might see
    Where that shrouded grave shall be--
    God! who hear'st the surges roll,
    Deign to save the sailor's soul.

1   Our little bark, on boisterous seas,
      By cruel tempests tossed,
    Without one cheerful beam of hope,
      Expecting to be lost,--

2   We to the Lord, in humble prayer,
      Breathed out our sad distress;
    Though feeble, yet with contrite hearts,
      We begged return of peace.

3   Then ceased the stormy winds to blow;
      The surges ceased to roll;
    And soon again a placid sea
      Spoke comfort to the soul.

4   O, may our grateful, trembling hearts
      Their hallelujahs sing
    To him who hath our lives preserved,--
      Our Father and our King.

Hymn at Sea.


1   O Thou who hast spread out the skies,
      And measured the depths of the sea,
    'Twixt heavens and ocean shall rise
      Our incense of praises to thee.

2   We know that thy presence is near
      While heaves our bark far from the land;--
    We ride o'er the deep without fear;--
      The waters are held in thy hand.

3   Eternity comes in the sound
      Of billows that never can sleep!
    There's Deity circling us round,--
      Omnipotence walks o'er the deep!

4   O Father, our eye is to thee,
      As on for the haven we roll;
    And faith in our Pilot shall be
      An anchor to steady the soul.




832.              L. M.                    Cowper.

Temptation compared to a Storm.


1   The billows swell; the winds are high;
    Clouds overcast my wintry sky:
    Out of the depths to thee I call;
    My fears are great, my strength is small.

2   O Lord, the pilot's part perform,
    And guide and guard me through the storm;
    Defend me from each threatening ill;
    Control the waves: say, "Peace! be still."




833.              L. M.          L. H. Signourney.

Prayer at Sea.


1   Prayer may be sweet in cottage homes,
      Where sire and child devoutly kneel,
    While through the open casement nigh
      The vernal blossoms fragrant steal.

2   Prayer may be sweet in stately halls,
      Where heart with kindred heart is blent,
    And upward to th' eternal throne
      The hymn of praise melodious sent.

3   But he who fain would know how warm
      The soul's appeal to God may be,
    From friends and native land should turn,
      A wanderer on the faithless sea;--

4   Should hear its deep, imploring tone
      Rise heavenward o'er the foaming surge,
    When billows toss the fragile bark,
      And fearful blasts the conflict urge.

5   Naught, naught appears but sea and sky;
      No refuge where the foot may flee:
    How will he cast, O Rock divine,
      The anchor of his soul on thee!

The Sailor's Grave.


1   Not in the church-yard shall he sleep,
      Amid the silent gloom,--
    His home was on the mighty deep,
      And there shall be his tomb.

2   He loved his own bright, deep blue sea,
      O'er it he loved to roam;
    And now his winding sheet shall be
      That same bright ocean's foam.

3   No village bell shall toll for him
      Its mournful, solemn dirge;
    The winds shall chant a requiem
      To him beneath the surge.

4   For him, break not the grassy turf,
      Nor turn the dewy sod;
    His dust shall rest beneath the surf,
      His spirit with its God.

Prayer for Seamen.


1   We come, O Lord, before thy throne,
      And, with united pleas,
    We meet and pray for those who roam
      Far off upon the seas.

2   O, may the Holy Spirit bow
      The sailor's heart to thee,
    Till tears of deep repentance flow
      Like rain-drops in the sea.

3   Then may a Saviour's dying love
      Pour peace into his breast,
    And waft him to the port above
      Of everlasting rest.

National Hymn.


1   My country 'tis of thee,
    Sweet land of liberty,
      Of thee I sing;
    Land where my fathers died,
    Land of the pilgrim's pride,
    From every mountain side
      Let freedom ring.

2   My native country, thee--
    Land of the noble, free--
      Thy name--I love;
    I love thy rocks and rills,
    Thy woods and templed hills;
    My heart with rapture thrills
      Like that above.

3   Let music swell the breeze,
    And ring from all the trees
      Sweet freedom's song:
    Let mortal tongues awake;
    Let all that breathe, partake;
    Let rocks their silence break,--
      The sound prolong.

4   Our fathers' God, to thee,
    Author of liberty,
      To thee we sing:
    Long may our land be bright
    With freedom's holy light;
    Protect us by thy might,
      Great God, our King.

Prayer for our Country.


1   Lord, while for all mankind we pray,
      Of every clime and coast,
    O, hear us for our native land,--
      The land we love the most.

2   O guard our shores from every foe,
      With peace our borders bless,
    With prosperous times our cities crown,
      Our fields with plenteousness.

3   Unite us in the sacred love
      Of knowledge, truth, and thee;
    And let our hills and valleys shout
      The songs of liberty.

4   Here may religion pure and mild
      Smile on our Sabbath hours;
    And piety and virtue bless
      The home of us and ours.

5   Lord of the nations, thus to thee
      Our country we commend;
    Be thou her refuge and her trust,
      Her everlasting friend.

The God of our Fathers.


1   Like Israel's hosts to exile driven,
      Across the flood the pilgrims fled;
    Their hands bore up the ark of Heaven,
      And Heaven their trusting footsteps led,
    Till on these savage shores they trod,
    And won the wilderness for God.

2   Then, where their weary ark found rest,
      Another Zion proudly grew;
    In more than Judah's glory dressed,
      With light that Israel never knew.
    From sea to sea her empire spread,
    Her temple Heaven, and Christ her head.

3   Then let the grateful church, to-day
      Its ancient rite with gladness keep;
    And still our fathers' God display
      His kindness, though the fathers sleep.
    O, bless, as thou hast blessed the past,
    While earth, and time, and heaven shall last.




839.              C. M.                     Watts.

"Thou shall teach them to thy children."


1   Let children hear the mighty deeds
      Which God performed of old:
    Which in our younger years we saw,
      And which our fathers told.

2   He bids us make his glories known--
      His works of power and grace;
    And we'll convey his wonders down
      To every rising race.

3   Our lips shall tell them to our sons,
      And they again to theirs;
    That generations yet unborn
      May teach them to their heirs.

4   Thus shall they learn, in God alone
      Their hope securely stands;
    That they may ne'er forget his works,
      But practise his commands.

"We have a goodly heritage."


1   In pleasant lands have fallen the lines
      That bound our goodly heritage,
    And safe beneath our sheltering vines
      Our youth is blest, and soothed our age.

2   What thanks, O God, to thee are due,
      That thou didst plant our fathers here;
    And watch and guard them as they grew,
      A vineyard, to the planter dear.

3   The toils they bore, our ease have wrought;
      They sowed in tears--in joy we reap;
    The birthright they so dearly bought
      We'll guard, till we with them shall sleep.

4   Thy kindness to our fathers shown
      In weal and woe through all the past,
    Their grateful sons, O God, shall own
      While here their name and race shall last.

God Acknowledged in National Blessings.


1   Great God of nations, now to thee
      Our hymn of gratitude we raise;
    With humble heart and bending knee,
      We offer thee our song of praise.

2   Here freedom spreads her banner wide,
      And casts her soft and hallowed ray;
    Here thou our fathers' steps didst guide
      In safety through their dangerous way.

3   We praise thee that the gospel's light
      Through all our land its radiance sheds,
    Dispels the shades of error's night,
      And heavenly blessings round us spreads.

4   Great God, preserve us in thy fear;
      In dangers still our guardian be;
    O, spread thy truth's bright precepts here,
      Let all the people worship thee.

Remembrance of our Fathers.


1   Great God! beneath whose piercing eye
    The world's extended kingdoms lie;
    Whose favoring smile upholds them all,
    Whose anger smites them, and they fall;

2   We bow before thy heavenly throne;
    Thy power we see, thy goodness own;
    But, cherished by thy milder voice,
    Our bosoms tremble and rejoice.

3   Thy kindness to our fathers shown,
    Their children's children long shall own;
    To thee with grateful hearts shall raise
    Their tribute of exulting praise.

4   Our God, our Guardian, and our Friend!
    Oh still thy sheltering arm extend;
    Preserved by thee for ages past,
    For ages may thy kindness last.

The Pilgrims.


1   Our fathers, Lord, to seek a spot
      Where they might kneel to thee,
    Their own fair heritage forgot,
      And braved an unknown sea.

2   Here found their pilgrim souls repose
      Where long the heathen roved;
    And here their humble anthems rose
      To bless the Power they loved.

3   They sleep in dust,--but where they trod,
      A feeble, fainting band,
    Glad millions catch the strain, O God,
      And sound it through the land.

Anniversary Hymn.


1   God of mercy, do thou never
      From our offering turn away,
    But command a blessing ever
      On the memory of this day.

2   Light and peace do thou ordain it;
      O'er it be no shadow flung,
    Let no deadly darkness stain it,
      And no clouds be o'er it hung.

3   May the song this people raises,
      And its vows to thee addressed,
    Mingle with the prayers and praises,
      That thou hearest from the blest.

4   When the lips are cold that sing thee,
      And the hearts that love thee dust,
    Father, then our souls shall bring thee
      Holier love and firmer trust.

1   Parent of all, omnipotent!
      In heaven and earth below!
    Through all creation's vast extent
      Whose streams of goodness flow:

2   Teach me to know from whence I rose,
      And unto what designed;
    No private aims may I propose,
      That injure human kind.

3   To hear my country's lawful voice
      May my best thoughts incline;
    'Tis reason's law, 'tis virtue's choice,
      'Tis nature's call, and thine.

4   Me from fair freedom's sacred cause
      May nothing e'er divide;
    Nor grandeur, gold, nor vain applause,
      Nor friendship false, misguide.

5   To duty, honor, virtue true,
      In all my country's weal,
    Let me my public walk pursue:
      So, God, thy favor deal.

      To cheer the plains below;
    He makes the grass the mountains crown,
      And corn in valleys grow.

3   His steady councils change the face
      Of each declining year;
    He bids the sun cut short his race,
      And wintry days appear.

4   On us his providence has shone,

3     The hills, on every side,
      Rejoice at falling showers:
    The meadows, dressed in all their pride,
      Perfume the air with flowers.

4     The ridges drink their fill,
      And ranks of corn appear;

      Thy goodness crowns the year.

Spring.


1   When verdure clothes the fertile vale,
      And blossoms deck the spray,
    And fragrance breathes in every gale,
      How sweet the vernal day!

2   Hark! how the feathered warblers sing!
      'Tis nature's cheerful voice;
    Soft music hails the lovely spring,
      And woods and fields rejoice.

3   O God of nature and of grace,
      Thy heavenly gifts impart;
    Then shall my meditation trace
      Spring blooming in my heart.

4   Inspired to praise, I then shall join
      Glad nature's cheerful song,
    And love and gratitude divine
      Attune my joyful tongue.

Spring.


1   When brighter suns and milder skies
      Proclaim the opening year,
    What various sounds of joy arise!
      What prospects bright appear!

2   Earth and her thousand voices give
      Their thousand notes of praise;
    And all, that by his mercy live,
      To God their offering raise.

3   The streams, all beautiful and bright,
      Reflect the morning sky;
    And there, with music in his flight,
      The wild bird soars on high.

4   Thus, like the morning, calm and clear,
      That saw the Saviour rise,
    The spring of heaven's eternal year
      Shall dawn on earth and skies.

5   No winter there, no shades of night,
      Obscure those mansions blest,
    Where, in the happy fields of light,
      The weary are at rest.

Spring-Time.


1   The spring, the joyous spring is come
    With lovely flowers of early bloom;
    The warbling birds, on every tree,
    Fill all the air with melody.

2   Once more, unsealed, the fountains run,
    Sparkling, beneath a brighter sun;
    Green leaves and tender herbs arise,
    Cheered by the glow of warmer skies.

3   Oh Lord, the changes of the year
    At thy Almighty word appear;
    And all the seasons, as they roll,
    Declare thy name from pole to pole.

4   Spring showers, descending from above,
    Bear down glad tidings of thy love,
    And every blossom on the tree
    Bespeaks our gratitude to thee.

Summer.


1     Great God, at thy command,
      Seasons in order rise:
    Thy power and love in concert reign
      Through earth, and seas, and skies.

2     How balmy is the air!
      How warm the sun's bright beams!
    While, to refresh the ground, the rains
      Descend in gentle streams.

3     With grateful praise we own
      Thy providential hand,
    While grass, and herbs, and waving corn,
      Adorn and bless the land.

4     But greater still the gift
      Of thy belovéd Son;
    By him forgiveness, peace, and joy,
      Through endless ages run.

"The Hymn of Summer."


1   How glad the tone when summer's sun
      Wreathes the gay world with flowers,
    And trees bend down with golden fruit,
      And birds are in the bowers!

2   The moon sends silent music down
      Upon each earthly thing;
    And always, since creation's dawn,
      The stars together sing.

3   Shall man remain in silence, then,
      While all beneath the skies
    The chorus joins? no, let us sing,
      And while our voices rise,

4   O, let our lives, great God, breathe forth
      A constant melody;
    And every action be a tone
      In that sweet hymn to thee!

Autumn.


1   The leaves, around me falling,
      Are preaching of decay;
    The hollow winds are calling,
      "Come, pilgrim, come away:"
    The day, in night declining,
      Says I must, too, decline;
    The year its bloom resigning,
      Its lot foreshadows mine.

2   The light my path surrounding,
      The loves to which I cling,
    The hopes within me bounding,
      The joys that round me wing,--
    All, all, like stars at even,
      Just gleam and shoot away,
    Pass on before to heaven,
      And chide at my delay.

3   The friends gone there before me
      Are calling from on high,
    And happy angels o'er me
      Tempt sweetly to the sky:
    "Why wait," they say, "and wither,
      'Mid scenes of death and sin?
    O, rise to glory, hither,
      And find true life begin."

Winter.


1   The hoary frost, the fleecy snow,
      Descend, and clothe the ground;
    The liquid streams forbear to flow,
      In icy fetters bound.

2   When, from his dreadful stores on high,
      God pours the sounding hail,
    The man that does his power defy
      Shall find his courage fail.

3   God sends his word and melts the snow;
      The fields no longer mourn;
    He calls the warmer gales to blow,
      And bids the spring return.

4   The changing wind, the flying cloud,
      Obey his mighty word;
    With songs and honors sounding loud,
      Praise ye the sovereign Lord.

      Thy skill and power divine.
        The rolling years

          In all we see
        A God appears.

2   In winter, awful thou!
      With storms around thee cast;
    The leafless forests bow
      Beneath thy northern blast.
        While tempests lower,
          To thee, dread King,
          We homage bring,
        And own thy power.

The Acceptable Fast.


1   This is the fast the Lord doth choose;
      Each heavy burden to undo,
    The bands of wickedness to loose,
      And bid the captive freely go.

2   Let every vile and sinful yoke
      Of servile bondage and of fear,
    By mercy, love and truth be broke;
      And from each eye wipe every tear.

3   Yes, to the hungry deal thy bread;
      Bring to thine house the outcast poor;
    There let the fainting soul be fed,
      Nor spurn the needy from thy door.

4   And when thou seest the naked, spare
      The raiment that his wants demand;
    Since all mankind thy kindred are,
      To all thy charity expand.

5   Thus did the Saviour of our race:
      Himself, the Bread of Life, he gave;
    He clothed us with his righteousness,
      And broke the fetters from the slave.

Humiliation and Prayer.


1   Here in thy temple, Lord, we meet,
      And bow before thy throne;
    Abased and guilty, at thy feet
      We seek thy grace alone.

2   Our sins rise up in dread array,
      And fill our hearts with fear;
    Our trembling spirits melt away,
      But find no helper near.

3   O, send thy pity from on high
      With pardon all-divine;
    Bring now thy gracious spirit nigh,
      And make us wholly thine.

4   We humbly mourn our follies past,
      Each guilty path deplore;
    Resolved, while feeble life shall last,
      To tread those paths no more.

2   O, let us feel how frail we are,
      How much we need thy grace;
    O, strengthen, Lord, our fainting souls,
      While here we seek thy face.

3   Our sins, alas! before thee rise;
      Thou knowest all our guilt;
    Let not our faith, our hope, our trust,
      On earthly things be built.

4   Forgive our sins, thy spirit grant,
      Let love our souls refine,
    And heavenly peace and holy hope
      Assure that we are thine.

1     "Is this a fast for me?"--
      Thus saith the Lord our God;--
    "A day for man to vex his soul,
      And feel affliction's rod?--

2     "Like bulrush low to bow
      His sorrow-stricken head,
    With sackcloth for his inner vest,
      And ashes round him spread?

3     "Shall day like this have power
      To stay th' avenging hand,
    Efface transgression, or avert
      My judgments from the land?

4     "No; is not this alone
      The sacred fast I choose,--
    Oppression's yoke be burst in twain,
      The bands of guilt unloose?--

5     "To nakedness and want
      Your food and raiment deal,
    To dwell your kindred race among,
      And all their sufferings heal?

6     "Then, like the morning ray,
      Shall spring your health and light;
    Before you, righteousness shall shine,
      Behind, my glory bright!"

Public Humiliation.


1   Great Maker of unnumbered worlds,
      And whom unnumbered worlds adore,--
    Whose goodness all thy creatures share,
      While nature trembles at thy power,--

2   Thine is the hand that moves the spheres,
      That wakes the wind, and lifts the sea;
    And man, who moves the lord of earth,
      Acts but the part assigned by thee.

3   While suppliant crowds implore thine aid,
      To thee we raise the humble cry;
    Thine altar is the contrite heart,
      Thine incense the repentant sigh.

4   O may our land, in this her hour,
      Confess thy hand, and bless the rod,
    By penitence make thee her friend,
      And find in thee a guardian God.

      Before Jehovah stood,
    And, with an humble, fervent prayer,
      For guilty Sodom sued,--

2   With what success, what wondrous grace,
      Was his petition crowned!
    The Lord would spare, if in this place
      Ten righteous men were found.

3   And could a single pious soul
      So rich a boon obtain?
    Great God, and shall a nation cry,
      And plead with thee in vain?

4   Are not the righteous dear to thee
      Now, as in ancient times?
    Or does this sinful land exceed
      Gomorrah in her crimes?

5   Still we are thine; we bear thy name;
      Here yet is thine abode:
    Long has thy presence blessed our land:
      Forsake us not, O God.

2   Dark judgments, from thy heavy hand,
      Thy dreadful power display;

3   How changed, alas! are truths divine,
      For error, guilt, and shame!
    What impious numbers, bold in sin,
      Disgrace the Christian name!

4   O, turn us, turn us, mighty Lord;
      Convert us by thy grace;
    Then shall our hearts obey thy word,
      And see again thy face.

    The raging waves, the furious wind,

    In loud thanksgivings raise
      Hand, heart, and voice;
    The valleys smile and sing,
    Forests and mountains ring,
    The plains their tribute bring,
      The streams rejoice.

2   Yea, bless his holy name,
    And purest thanks proclaim
      Through all the earth;
    To glory in your lot
    Is duty,--but be not
    God's benefits forgot,
      Amidst your mirth.

3   The God of harvest praise;
    Hands, hearts, and voices raise,
      With sweet accord;
    From field to garner throng,
    Bearing your sheaves along,
    And in your harvest song
      Bless ye the Lord.

      The sower hid the grain,
    Thy goodness marked its secret birth,
      And sent the early rain.

3   The spring's sweet influence, Lord, was thine
      The plants in beauty grew;
    Thou gav'st refulgent suns to shine,
      And mild, refreshing dew.

4   These various mercies from above
      Matured the swelling grain;
    A kindly harvest crowns thy love,
      And plenty fills the plain.

5   We own and bless thy gracious sway;
      Thy hand all nature hails;
    Seed-time nor harvest, night nor day,
      Summer nor winter, fails.

    "Thou givest us the finest wheat;"
    "The joy of harvest" we have known;
    The praise, O Lord! is all thine own.

3   Our tables spread, our garners stored,
    O give us hearts to bless thee, Lord!
    Forbid it, Source of light and love,
    That hearts and lives should barren prove.

4   Another harvest comes apace;
    Ripen our spirits by thy grace,
    That we may calmly meet the blow
    The sickle gives to lay us low.

5   That so, when angel reapers come
    To gather sheaves to thy blest home,
    Our spirits may be borne on high
    To thy safe garner in the sky.

    When russet autumn decks her brows;

3   For the bright sun, whose fervid ray
    Ripens the corn, and cheers the day;
    For the round moon, whose yellow light
    Gilds the long labors of the night;

4   For the rich sea of shining grain,
    That spreads its waves o'er hill and plain,
    For the cool breeze, whose light wings fan
    The weary, sun-burnt husbandman;

5   For the soft herbage of the soil,
    For ruddy health, the child of toil;
    For all the good the year displays,
    Accept, O God, our grateful praise.

1   How rich thy gifts, Almighty King!
    From thee our public blessings spring;
      Th' extended trade, the fruitful skies,
    The treasures liberty bestows,
    Th' eternal joys the gospel shows,--
      All from thy boundless goodness rise.

2   Here commerce spreads the wealthy store,

      As truth and conscience point the way.

3   With grateful hearts, with joyful tongues,
    To God we raise united songs;
      His power and mercy we proclaim;
    This land through every age shall own,
    Jehovah here has fixed his throne,
      And triumph in his mighty name.

4   Long as the moon her course shall run,
    Or man behold the circling sun,
      O, still may God amidst us reign;
    Crown our just counsels with success,
    With peace and joy our borders bless,
      And all our sacred rights maintain.

    Still we are guarded by our God;
    By his incessant bounty fed,
    By his unerring counsel led.

3   With grateful hearts the past we own:
    The future, all to us unknown,
    We to thy guardian care commit,
    And peaceful leave before thy feet,

4   In scenes exalted or depressed,
    Be thou our joy, and thou our rest:
    Thy goodness all our hopes shall raise,
    Adored through all our changing days.

5   When death shall interrupt these songs,
    And seal in silence mortal tongues,
    Our Helper, God, in whom we trust,
    In better worlds our souls shall boast.

1   Remark, my soul, the narrow bounds
      Of the revolving year;
    How swift the weeks complete their rounds!
      How short the months appear!

2   Yet like an idle tale we pass
      The swift advancing year;
    And study artful ways t' increase
      The speed of its career.

3   Waken, O God, my trifling heart,
      Its great concerns to see;
    That I may act the Christian part,
      And give the year to thee.

4   Thus shall their course more grateful roll,
      If future years arise;
    Or this shall bear my peaceful soul
      To joy that never dies.

      But how little none can know.

2   As the wingéd arrow flies,
      Speedily the mark to find;
    As the lightning from the skies
      Darts and leaves no trace behind;--
    Swiftly thus our fleeting days
      Bear us down life's rapid stream:
    Upward, Lord, our spirits raise;
      All below is but a dream.

3   Thanks for mercies past receive;
      Pardon of our sins renew;
    Teach us, henceforth, how to live,
      With eternity in view;
    Bless thy word to old and young;
      Fill us with a Saviour's love;
    When our life's short race is run,
      May we dwell with thee above.

1   My helper, God, I bless his name;
    The same his power, his grace the same;
    The tokens of his friendly care
    Open, and crown, and close, the year.

2   I 'midst ten thousand dangers stand,
    Supported by his guardian hand,
    And see, when I survey my ways,
    Ten thousand monuments of praise.

3   Thus far his arm hath led me on;
    Thus far I make his mercy known;
    And, while I tread this mortal land,
    New mercies shall new songs demand.

New Year. Providential Goodness.


1   God of our lives, thy various praise
      Our voices shall resound:
    Thy hand directs our fleeting days,
      And brings the seasons round.

2   To thee shall grateful songs arise,
      Our Father and our Friend,
    Whose constant mercies from the skies
      In genial streams descend.

3   In every scene of life, thy care,
      In every age, we see;
    And constant as thy favors are,
      So let our praises be.

4   Still may thy love, in every scene,
      In every age, appear;
    And let the same compassion deign
      To bless the opening year.

5   If mercy smile, let mercy bring
      Our wandering souls to God:
    In our affliction we shall sing,
      If thou wilt bless the rod.

1   O God, my helper, ever near!
    Crown with thy smile the present year;
    Preserve me by thy favor still,
    And fit me for thy sacred will.

2   My safety, each succeeding hour,
    Depends on thy supporting power:
    Accept my thanks for mercies past,
    And be my guard, while life shall last.

3   My moments move with wingéd haste,
    Nor know I which shall be the last:
    Danger and death are ever nigh,
    And I this year perhaps may die.

4   Prepare me for the trying day;
    Then call my willing soul away:
    I'll quit the world at thy command,
    And trust my spirit to thy hand.

1   Now, gracious Lord, thine arm reveal,
      And make thy glory known;
    Now let us all thy presence feel,
      And soften hearts of stone.

2   From all the guilt of former sin
      May mercy set us free;
    And let the year we now begin,
      Begin and end with thee.

3   Send down thy spirit from above,
      That saints may love thee more,
    And sinners now may learn to love,
      Who never loved before.

4   And when before thee we appear,
      In our eternal home,
    May growing numbers worship here,
      And praise thee in our room.

Self-Examination. New Year.


1   As o'er the past my memory strays,
      Why heaves the secret sigh?
    'Tis that I mourn departed days,
      Still unprepared to die.

2   The world, and worldly things beloved,
      My anxious thoughts employed;
    And time unhallowed, unimproved,
      Presents a fearful void.

3   Yet, Holy Father! wild despair
      Chase from my laboring breast;
    Thy grace it is which prompts the prayer.
      That grace can do the rest.

4   My life's brief remnant all be thine;
      And when thy sure decree
    Bids me this fleeting breath resign,
      O speed my soul to thee!

    Make us willing to be thine.

2   Where thou hast thy work begun,
    Give new strength the race to run;
    Scatter darkness, doubts, and fears,

3   Bless us all, both old and young;
    Call forth praise from every tongue:
    Let our whole assembly prove
    All thy power and all thy love!

The Closing Year.


1   And now, my soul, another year
      Of my short life is past:
    I cannot long continue here;
      And this may be my last.

2   Part of my doubtful life is gone,
      Nor will return again;
    And swift my fleeting moments run--
      The few which yet remain!

3   Awake, my soul! with all thy care
      Thy true condition learn;
    What are thy hopes--how sure, how fair,
      And what thy great concern?

4   Now a new space of life begins,
      Set out afresh for heaven;
    Seek pardon for thy former sins,
      Through Christ, so freely given.

5   Devoutly yield thyself to God,
      And on his grace depend;
    With zeal pursue the heavenly road,
      Nor doubt a happy end.

1   Time by moments steals away,
    First the hour and then the day;
    Small the daily loss appears,
    Yet it soon amounts to years.

2   Thus another year is flown;
    Now it is no more our own,
    If it brought or promised good,
    Than the years before the flood.

3   But may none of us forget
    It has left us much in debt;
    Who can tell the vast amount
    Placed to every one's account!

4   Favors, from the Lord received,
    Sins, that have his spirit grieved,
    Marked by an unerring hand,
    In his book recorded stand.

5   If we see another year,
    May thy blessing meet us here:
    Sun of righteousness, arise,
    Warm our hearts and bless our eyes.

1   Time! what an empty vapor 'tis!
      And days, how swift they are!
    Swift as an Indian arrow flies,
      Or like a shooting star.

2   The present moments just appear,
      Then slide away in haste;
    That we can never say, they're here;
      But only say, they're past.

3   Our life is ever on the wing,
      And death is ever nigh;
    The moment when our lives begin
      We all begin to die.

4   Yet, mighty God! our fleeting days
      Thy lasting favors share;
    Yet, with the bounties of thy grace,
      Thou load'st the rolling year.

5   'Tis sovereign mercy finds us food,
      And we are clothed with love;
    While grace stands pointing out the road
      Which leads our souls above.

    High was thy throne ere heaven was made,

2   Long hadst thou reigned ere time began,
    Or dust was fashioned into man;
    And long thy kingdom shall endure,
    When earth and time shall be no more.

3   A thousand of our years amount
    Scarce to a day in thine account;
    Like yesterday's departed light,
    Or the last watch of ending night.

4   Death, like an overflowing stream,
    Sweeps us away; our life's a dream,
    An empty tale, a morning flower
    Cut down and withered in an hour.

2   How many precious souls are fled
    To the vast regions of the dead,
    Since, from this day, the changing sun
    Through his last yearly course has run!

3   We yet survive, but who can say,
    Or through the year, or month, or day,
    We shall retain this vital breath,
    Secure from all the shafts of death?

4   We hold our lives from thee alone,
    On earth, or in the worlds unknown;
    To thee our spirits we resign,
    Make them and own them all as thine.

5   Great Source of wisdom, teach my heart

The Joy of Social Worship.


1   How good and pleasant is the sight,
      How great the bliss they share,
    When Christ's assembled flock unite
      In acts of social prayer!
    God thither, with paternal care,
      His face benignant bends;
    And Jesus, by his spirit there,
      On faithful hearts descends.

2   To such, by hallowed lips expressed,
      His grace confirms his word,
    As once Cornelius' house it blest,
      From holy Peter heard:
    On prayer and praise, in faith preferred,
      His heavenly dew is shed;
    And he to all, who come prepared,
      Dispenses heavenly bread.

3   To God, adored in ages past,
      Enthroned in majesty,--
    To God, whose worship aye shall last
      Throughout eternity,--
    To thee, Great God, we bend the knee,
      And in the Holy Ghost,
    Through Christ, all glory give to thee,
      With all thy heavenly host.

The Joy of Social Devotion.


1   O, it is joy in one to meet
      Whom one communion blends,
    Council to hold in converse sweet,
      And talk as Christian friends.

2   'Tis joy to think the angel train,
      Who 'mid heaven's temple shine,
    To seek our earthly temples deign,
      And in our anthems join.

3   But chief, 'tis joy to think that He,
      To whom his church is dear,
    Delights her gathered flock to see,
      Her joint devotions hear.

4   Then who would choose to walk abroad,
      While here such joys are given?
    "This is indeed the house of God,
      And this the gate of heaven!"

2   In the name of Christ we come,
      Asking grace and seeking peace,
    Raise our hearts to heaven, our home,
      And from worldly cares release.

3   Pure and holy may we be,
      Far removed all vain desire;
    From all hate and envy free,
      Let our souls to thee aspire.

4   While we love the Saviour's name,
      And his words with zeal obey,
    His sweet promise we may claim;--

    Walk in holiness of life;

2   Still forget the things behind;
    Follow Christ in heart and mind;
    Toward the mark unwearied press;
    Seize the crown of righteousness,
    While we walk with God in light,
    God our hearts will still unite;
    Dearest fellowship we prove--
    Fellowship in Jesus, love.

3   Still, O Lord, our faith increase;
    Cleanse from all unrighteousness:
    Thee th' unholy cannot see:
    Make, O make us meet for thee:
    Every vile affection kill;
    Root out every seed of ill;
    Utterly abolish sin;
    Write thy law of love within.

      Be ours, with one consent,
    The worship of the lowly brow,
      And knees devoutly bent!

3   But chief, inflamed with heavenly fire,
      Devotion's better part,
    Be ours instinct with one desire,
      The worship of the heart!

2   Still let us own our common Lord,
      And bear his easy yoke,
    A band of love, a three-fold cord
      Which never can be broke.

3   Make us into one spirit drink;
      Baptize into one name;
    And let us always kindly think,
      And sweetly speak the same.

4   Touched by the loadstone of thy love,
      Let all our hearts agree;
    And ever towards each other move,
      And ever move towards thee.

    Every stumbling-block remove;
    Each to each unite, endear;
    Come, and spread thy banner here.

2   Make us of one heart and mind,
    Courteous, pitiful, and kind;
    Lowly, meek, in thought and word,
    Altogether like our Lord.
    Let us for each other care;
    Each the other's burden bear;
    To thy church the pattern give;
    Show how true believers live.

3   Free from anger and from pride,
    Let us thus in God abide;
    All the depths of love express,
    All the heights of holiness.
    Let us, then, with joy remove
    To the family above;
    On the wings of angels fly;
    Show how true believers die.

    Inhabitest the humble mind;
    Such ever bring thee where they come,
    And, going, take thee to their home.

3   Here may we prove the power of prayer
    To strengthen faith, and sweeten care;
    To teach our faint desires to rise,
    And bring all heaven before our eyes.

4   Lord, we are few, but thou art near;
    Nor short thine arm, nor deaf thine ear:
    O, rend the heavens, comes quickly down,
    And make a thousand hearts thine own!

1   Blest with unearthly bliss were they

    And strove their Christian part to bear,
    By sign and spirit joined with her.

2   The truth, which Christ's apostles taught,
    Then ruled each faithful convert's thought;
    Each aimed in unity to keep
    Unrent th' apostles' fellowship.

3   The bread, with rites harmonious broke,
    The union of all hearts bespoke;
    And prayer, with lips united prayed,
    The union of all minds displayed.

4   O thus that Christians still would live,
    And thus delightful witness give,
    How well the debt of love they know,
    To Christ and to his church they owe!

      And nearer to our Lord.

Christian Union.


1   Lo! what an entertaining sight
      Those friendly brethren prove,
    Whose cheerful hearts in bands unite
      Of harmony and love!

2   Where streams of bliss from Christ, the spring,
      Descend to every soul,
    And heavenly peace, with balmy wing,
      Shades and bedews the whole.

3   'Tis pleasant as the morning dews
      That fall on Zion's hill,
    Where God his mildest glory shows,
      And makes his grace distil.




919.              S. M.             Sacred Lyrics.

Morning Prayer Meeting.


1     How sweet the melting lay,
      Which breaks upon the ear,
    When, at the hour of rising day,
      Christians unite in prayer!

2     The breezes waft their cries
      Up to Jehovah's throne;
    He listens to their humble sighs,
      And sends his blessings down.

3     So Jesus rose to pray
      Before the morning light,--
    Once on the chilling mount did stay,
      And wrestle all the night.

4     Glory to God on high,
      Who sends his blessings down
    To rescue souls condemned to die,
      And make his people one.




920.              C. M.             Ancient Hymns.

Social Evening Worship.


1   O, 'Tis a scene the heart to move,
      When, at the close of day,
    Whom God unites in Christian love
      Unite their thanks to pay.

2   What though the number be but small;
      Whenever two or three
    Join on the Saviour's name to call,
      There in the midst is he.

3   When faithful and repentant hearts
      His heavenly grace ensue,
    His grace, intreated, he imparts
      To many or to few.

4   O, come, then, and, with joint accord,
      In social worship meet;
    And, mindful of the Saviour's word,
      The Saviour's boon intreat.




921.             7s. M.                    Newton.

Parting Hymn.


1   For a season called to part,
      Let us then ourselves commend
    To the gracious eye and heart
      Of our ever-present Friend.

2   Father, hear our humble prayer!
      Tender shepherd of thy sheep,
    Let thy mercy and thy care
      All our souls in safety keep.

3   In thy strength may we be strong;
      Sweeten every cross and pain;
    Give us, if we live, ere long,
      Here to meet in peace again.




922.              C. M.            Methodist Coll.

The Same.


1   Through thee we now together came,
      In singleness of heart;
    We met, O, Jesus, in thy name,
      And in thy name we part.

2   We part in body, not in mind;
      Our minds continue one;
    And, each to each in Jesus joined,
      We hand in hand go on.

3   Present we still in spirit are,
      And intimately nigh,
    While on the wings of faith and prayer
      We each to other fly.

4   Our life is hid with Christ in God;
      Our life shall soon appear,
    And shed his glory all abroad
      In all his members here.




923.              L. M.                 Doddridge.

The Christian Farewell.


1   Thy presence, everlasting God!
    Wide o'er all nature spreads abroad:
    Thy watchful eyes, which cannot sleep,
    In every place thy children keep.

2   While near each other we remain,
    Thou dost our lives and souls sustain;
    When sep'rate, happy if we share
    Thy smiles, thy counsels, and thy care.

3   To thee we all our ways commit,
    And seek our comforts near thy feet;
    Still on our souls vouchsafe to shine,
    And guard and guide us still as thine.

4   Give us in thy belovéd house,
    Again to pay our grateful vows;
    Or, if that joy no more be known,
    Give us to meet around thy throne.




924.          8s. & 7s. M.              C. Wesley.

Domestic Worship.


1   Peace be to this habitation;
      Peace to all that dwell therein;
    Peace, the earnest of salvation;
      Peace, the fruit of pardoned sin;
    Peace, that speaks the heavenly Giver;
      Peace, to worldly minds unknown;
    Peace divine, that lasts forever;
      Peace, that comes from God alone.

2   Jesus, Prince of Peace, be near us;
      Fix in all our hearts thy home;
    With thy gracious presence cheer us;
      Let thy sacred kingdom come;
    Raise to heaven our expectation,
      Give our favored souls to prove
    Glorious and complete salvation,
      In the realms of bliss above.




925.              L. M.       Doddridge & Merrick.

The Same.  Ps. 128.


1   Blest is the man who fears the Lord,
    And walks by his unerring word;
    Comfort and peace his days attend,
    And God will ever prove his friend.

2   To him who condescends to dwell
    With saints in their obscurest cell,
    Be our domestic altars raised,
    And daily let his name be praised.

3   To him may each assembled house
    Present their night and morning vows;
    And children of the rising race
    Be taught his precepts and his grace.

4   When nature droops, our aged eyes
    Shall see our children's children rise;
    Till pleased and thankful we remove,
    And join the family above.




926.              L. M.                     Scott.

Family Religion.


1   Where'er the Lord shall build my house,
      An altar to his name I'll raise;
    There, morn and evening, shall ascend
      The sacrifice of prayer and praise.

2   With duteous mind, the social band
      Shall search the records of thy law;
    There learn thy will, and humbly bow
      With filial reverence and awe.

3   Here may he fix his sacred seat,
      And spread the banner of his love;
    Till, ripened for a happier state,
      We meet the family above.




927.            L. M. 6l.          Methodist Coll.

Religion at Home.


1   When quiet in my house I sit
      Thy book be my companion still;
    My joy thy sayings to repeat,
      Talk o'er the records of thy will,
    And search the oracles divine,
    Till every heart-felt word be mine.

2   O may the gracious words divine
      Mingled with all my converse be:
    So will the Lord his follower join,
      And walk and talk himself with me;
    So shall my heart his presence prove
    And burn with everlasting love.

3   Oft as I lay me down to rest,
      O, may the reconciling word
    Sweetly compose my weary breast,
      While, trusting in my gracious Lord,
    I sink in peaceful dreams away,
    And visions of eternal day!

4   Rising to sing my Father's praise,
      Thee may I publish all day long;
    And let thy precious word of grace
      Flow from my heart and fill my tongue;
    Fill all my life with purest love,
    And join me to the church above.

Family Affection from Religious Principles.


1     How pleasing, Lord! to see,
      How pure is the delight,
    When mutual love, and love to thee,
      A family unite!

2     From these celestial springs
      Such streams of comfort flow,
    As no increase of riches brings,
      Nor honors can bestow.

3     No bliss can equal theirs,
      Where such affections meet;
    While mingled praise and mingled prayers
      Make their communion sweet.

4     'Tis the same pleasure fills
      The breast in worlds above;
    Where joy like morning dew distils,
      And all the air is love.




929.              C. M.             Taylor's Coll.

The Family Altar.


1   Great God! where'er we pitch our tent,
      Let us an altar raise,
    And there, with humble frame, present
      Our sacrifice of praise.

2   To thee we give our health and strength,
      While health and strength shall last,
    For future mercies humbly trust,
      Nor e'er forget the past.

For a Sick Child.


1   Send down thy wingéd angel; God!
      Amidst this night so wild,
    And bid him come where now we watch,
      And breathe upon our child!

2   It lies upon its pillow, pale,
      And moans within its sleep,
    Or wakeneth with a patient smile,
      And striveth not to weep!

3   How gentle and how good a child
      It is, we know too well;
    And dearer to its parents' hearts
      Than our weak words can tell.

4   We love,--we watch throughout the night,
      To aid, where need may be;
    We hope,--and have despaired at times;
      But now we turn to thee!

5   Send down thy sweet-souled angel, God!
      Amidst the darkness wild,
    And bid him soothe our souls to-night,
      And heal our gentle child!




931.              C. M.                     Heber.

In Times of Domestic Distress.


1   O God, that madest earth and sky!
      The darkness and the day!
    Give ear to this thy family,
      And help us when we pray!
    For wide the waves of bitterness
      Around our vessel roar,
    And heavy grows the pilot's heart
      To view the rocky shore!

2   The cross our Master bore for us,
      For him we fain would bear,
    But mortal strength to weakness turns,
      And courage to despair!
    Then mercy on our failings, Lord!
      Our sinking faith renew!
    And when thy sorrows visit us,
      O send thy patience too.




932.              C. M.                 Doddridge.

Sickness and Recovery.


1   My God, thy service well demands
      The remnant of my days;
    Why was this fleeting breath renewed,
      But to renew thy praise?

2   Thine arms of everlasting love
      Did this weak frame sustain,
    When life was hovering o'er the grave,
      And nature sunk with pain.

3   I calmly bowed my fainting head
      On thy dear, faithful breast,
    And waited for my Father's call
      To his eternal rest.

4   Back from the borders of the grave,
      At thy command, I come;
    Nor will I ask a speedier flight
      To my celestial home.

5   Where thou appointest mine abode
      There would I choose to be;
    For in thy presence death is life,
      And earth is heaven with thee.

A Family Evening Prayer.


1   O Lord, another day is flown,
      And we, a lonely band,
    Are met once more before thy throne,
      To bless thy fostering hand.

2   And wilt thou lend a listening ear
      To praises low as ours!
    Thou wilt; for thou dost love to hear
      The song which meekness pours.

3   O, let thy grace perform its part,
      And let contention cease;
    And shed abroad in every heart
      Thine everlasting peace.

4   Thus chastened, cleansed, entirely thine,
      A flock by Jesus led,
    The Sun of holiness shall shine
      In glory on our head.

5   And thou wilt turn our wandering feet,
      And thou wilt bless our way,
    Till worlds shall fade, and faith shall greet
      The dawn of lasting day.

Family Hymn. Evening.


1   Father, we bless the gentle care
      That watches o'er us day by day,
    That guards us from the tempter's snare,
      And guides us in the heavenward way:--
    We bless thee for the tender love,
      That mingles all our hearts in one,--
    The music of the soul;--above
      'Tis purer spirits' unison.

2   Father, 'tis evening's solemn hour,
      And cast we now our cares on thee;
    Darkly the storm may round us lower,--
      Peace is within,--Christ makes us free,--
    And when life's toil and joy are o'er,
      And evening gathers on its sky,
    Our circle broke,--we sing no more,--
      O, may we meet and sing on high.




MORNING AND EVENING HYMNS.

Morning Hymn.


1   Oh! timely happy, timely wise.
    Hearts that with rising morn arise!
    Eyes that the beam celestial view,
    Which evermore makes all things new!

2   New every morning is the love
    Our wakening and uprising prove;
    Through sleep and darkness safely brought,
    Restored to life, and power, and thought.

3   New mercies, each returning day,
    Hover around us while we pray;
    New perils past, new sins forgiven,
    New thoughts of God, new hopes of heaven.

4   If, on our daily course, our mind
    Be set to hallow all we find,
    New treasures still, of countless price,
    God will provide for sacrifice.

5   Old friends, old scenes, will lovelier be,
    As more of heaven in each we see;
    Some softening gleams of love and prayer,
    Shall dawn on every cross and care.




936.              L. M.               Bishop Kenn.

Morning Resolutions.


1   Awake, my soul! and with the sun
    Thy daily stage of duty run;
    Shake off dull sloth, and joyful rise
    To pay thy morning sacrifice.

2   Wake, and lift up thyself, my heart,
    And with the angels bear thy part,
    Who all night long unwearied sing
    High praises to th' eternal King.

3   In conversation be sincere;
    Keep conscience, as the noontide, clear;
    Think how the all-seeing God thy ways
    And all thy secret thoughts surveys.

4   Lord, I my vows to thee renew;
    Scatter my sins like morning dew;
    Guard my first springs of thought and will
    And with thyself my spirit fill.

5   Direct, control, suggest, this day,
    All I design, or do, or say,
    That all my powers, with all their might,
    In thy sole glory may unite.

Acknowledging God's Hand. Morning.


1   What secret hand, at morning light,
      Softly unseals mine eye,
    Draws back the curtain of the night,
      And opens earth and sky;

2   'Tis thine, my God,--the same that kept
      My resting hours from harm;
    No ill came nigh me, for I slept
      Beneath th' Almighty's arm.

3   'Tis thine, my daily bread that brings,
      Like manna scattered round,
    And clothes me, as the lily springs
      In beauty from the ground.

4   In death's dark valley though I stray
      'Twould there my steps attend,
    Guide with the staff my lonely way,
      And with the rod defend.

5   May that sure hand uphold me still
      Through life's uncertain race,
    To bring me to thy holy hill,
      And to thy dwelling-place.

Morning Hymn.


1   Now, the shades of night are gone;
    Now the morning light comes on;
    Lord, may we be thine to-day,
    Drive the shades of sin away.

2   Fill our souls with heavenly light,
    Banish doubt, and clear our sight;
    In thy service, Lord, to-day,
    May we stand, and watch and pray.

3   Keep our haughty passions bound;
    Save us from our foes around;
    Going out and coming in,
    Keep us safe from every sin.

4   When our work of life is past,
    O, receive us then at last;
    Night and sin will be no more,
    When we reach the heavenly shore.

1   God of the morning, at whose voice
      The cheerful sun makes haste to rise,
    And like a giant doth rejoice
      To run his journey through the skies.

2   From the fair chambers of the east,
      The circuit of his race begins,
    And, without weariness or rest,
      Round the whole earth he flies and shines.

3   O, like the sun may I fulfil
      The appointed duties of the day,
    With ready mind and active will
      March on and keep my heavenly way.

4   Lord, thy commands are clean and pure,
      Enlightening our beclouded eyes,
    Thy threatenings just, thy promise sure,
      Thy gospel makes the simple wise.

1   Lord of my life! O may thy praise
      Employ my noblest powers,
    Whose goodness lengthens out my days.
      And fills the circling hours!

2   Preserved by thy almighty arm,
      I passed the shades of night,
    Serene and safe from every harm,
      And see returning light.

3   While many spend the night in sighs
      And restless pains and woes,
    In gentle sleep I close my eyes
      And undisturbed repose.

4   When sleep death's semblance o'er me spread,
      And I unconscious lay,
    Thy watchful care was round my bed,
      To guard my feeble clay.

5   O let the same almighty care
      My waking hours attend;
    From every danger, every snare,
      My heedless steps defend.

1   My God, how endless is thy love!
      Thy gifts are every evening new;
    And morning mercies, from above,
      Gently distil like early dew.

2   Thou spread'st the curtains of the night,
      Great Guardian of my sleeping hours;
    Thy sovereign word restores the light,
      And quickens all my drowsy powers.

3   I yield my powers to thy command;
      To thee I consecrate my days;
    Perpetual blessings from thine hand
      Demand perpetual songs of praise.

Confidence in God's Protection.


1   Father, breathe an evening blessing
      Ere repose our spirits seal;
    Sin and want we come confessing;
      Thou canst save and thou canst heal.

2   Though destruction walk around us,
      Though the arrows past us fly,
    Angel guards from thee surround us;
      We are safe, if thou art nigh.

3   Though the night be dark and dreary,
      Darkness cannot hide from thee;
    Thou art he who, never weary,
      Watchest where thy people be.

4   Should swift death this night o'ertake us,
      And command us to the tomb,
    May the morn in heaven awake us,
      Clad in bright, eternal bloom.

1   Father! thy paternal care
      Has my guardian been, my guide!
    Every hallowed wish and prayer
      Has thy hand of love supplied;
    Thine is every thought of bliss,
      Left by hours and days gone by;
    Every hope thy offspring is,
      Beaming from futurity.

2   Every sun of splendid ray;
      Every moon that shines serene;
    Every morn that welcomes day;
      Every evening's twilight scene,
    Every hour which wisdom brings;
      Every incense at thy shrine;
    These--and all life's holiest things,
      And its fairest--all are thine.

3   And for all, my hymns shall rise
      Daily to thy gracious throne:
    Thither let my asking eyes
      Turn unwearied--righteous One!
    Through life's strange vicissitude
      There reposing all my care,
    Trusting still through ill and good,
      Fixed and cheered and counselled there.

Reflections at Sunset.


1   The mellow eve is gliding
      Serenely down the west;
    So, every care subsiding,
      My soul would sink to rest.

2   The woodland hum is ringing
      The daylight's gentle close;
    May angels round me singing,
      Thus hymn my last repose.

3   The evening star has lighted
      Her crystal lamp on high;
    So, when in death benighted,
      May hope illume the sky.

4   In golden splendor dawning,
      The morrow's light shall break;
    O, on the last bright morning
      May I in glory wake.

Evening Hymn.


1   Thus far the Lord has led me on,
      Thus far his power prolongs my days!
    And every evening shall make known
      Some fresh memorial of his grace.

2   Much of my time has run to waste,
      And I, perhaps, am near my home;
    But he forgives my follies past,
      He gives me strength for days to come.

3   I lay my body down to sleep;
      Peace is the pillow for my head:
    While well appointed angels keep
      Their watchful stations round my bed.

4   Faith in his name forbids my fear:
      O, may thy presence ne'er depart!
    And in the morning make me hear
      Thy love and kindness in my heart.

5   And when the night of death shall come,
      Still may I trust almighty love,--
    The love which triumphs o'er the tomb,
      And leads to perfect bliss above.

    For all the blessings of the light:
    Keep me, O, keep me, King of kings,
    Beneath the shadow of thy wings.

2   Forgive me, Lord, through thy dear Son
    The ills which I this day have done;
    That with the world, myself, and thee,
    I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

3   O, may my soul on thee repose,
    And with sweet sleep mine eyelids close!
    Sleep that shall me more vigorous make
    To serve my God when I awake.

4   Be thou my Guardian while I sleep;
    Thy watchful station near me keep;
    My heart with love celestial fill,
    And guard me from th' approach of ill.

5   Lord, let my heart forever share
    The bliss of thy paternal care:
    'Tis heaven on earth, 'tis heaven above,
    To see thy face and sing thy love.

    O let my grateful praise and prayer
      Ascend before thy throne!

2   What mercies has this day bestowed!
      How largely hast thou blest!
    My cup with plenty overflowed,
      With cheerfulness my breast.

3   Now may sweet slumbers close my eyes,
      From pain and sickness free;
    And let my waking thoughts arise
      To meditate on thee.

4   So bless each future day and night,
      Till life's fond scene is o'er;
    At length, to realms of endless light
      Enraptured let me soar.

"Abide with us, for it is towards evening, and the day is far spent."


1   'Tis gone, that bright and orbéd blaze,
    Fast fading from our wistful gaze;
    Yon mantling cloud has hid from sight
    The last faint pulse of quivering light.

2   Sun of my soul! thou Saviour dear,
    It is not night if thou be near:
    Oh may no earth-born cloud arise
    To hide thee from thy servant's eyes.

3   When the soft dews of kindly sleep
    My wearied eyelids gently steep,
    Be my last thought now sweet to rest
    Forever on my Saviour's breast.

4   Abide with me from morn till eve,
    For without thee I cannot live;
    Abide with me when night is nigh,
    For without thee I dare not die.

1   Interval of grateful shade,
    Welcome to my weary head!
    Welcome slumbers to mine eyes,
    Tired with glaring vanities!

2   My great Master still allows
    Needful periods of repose:
    By my heavenly Father blest,
    Thus I give my powers to rest.

3   Heavenly Father, gracious name!
    Night and day his love the same!
    Far be each suspicious thought,
    Every anxious care forgot!

4   Thou, my ever-bounteous God,
    Crown'st my days with various good;
    Thy kind eye which cannot sleep,
    My defenceless hours shall keep.

5   Blest vicissitude to me!
    Day and night I'm still with thee;
    Guarded thus I sink to rest,
    Lodged within my Father's breast

    Seeks oblivion's balm in vain,

1   My God, I now from sleep awake;
    The sole possession of me take;
    From midnight terrors me secure,
    And guard my heart from thoughts impure.

2   Blest angels, while we silent lie,
    You hallelujahs sing on high;
    You joyful hymn the Ever-blest,
    Before the throne, and never rest.

3   I with your choir celestial join,
    In offering up a hymn divine;
    With you in heaven I hope to dwell,
    And bid the night and world farewell.

4   Blest Jesus, thou, on heaven intent,
    Whole nights hast in devotion spent;
    But I, frail creature, soon am tired,
    And all my zeal is soon expired.

5   Shine on me, Lord, new life impart,
    Fresh ardors kindle in my heart:
    One ray of thy all-quickening light
    Dispels the sloth and clouds of night.

Saturday Evening.


1     The hours of evening close;
      Its lengthened shadows, drawn
    O'er scenes of earth, invite repose,
      And wait the Sabbath dawn.

2     So let its calm prevail
      O'er forms of outward care;
    Nor thought for "many things" assail
      The still retreat of prayer.

3     Our guardian Shepherd near
      His watchful eye will keep;
    And, safe from violence and fear,
      Will fold his flock to sleep.

4     So may a holier light
    Than earth's our spirits rouse,
    And call us, strengthened by his might,
    To pay the Lord our vows.

      The Sabbath's peaceful hours begin;
    How grateful to the anxious breast,
    The sacred hours of holy rest.

2   Hushed is the tumult of this day,
      And worldly cares and business cease;
    While soft the vesper breezes play,
      To hymn the glad return of peace.
    O season blest! O moment given
    To turn the vagrant thoughts to heaven.

3   Oft as this hallowed hour shall come,
      O raise my thoughts from earthly things,
    And bear them to my heavenly home,
      On living faith's immortal wings--
    Till the last gleam of life decay,
    In one eternal Sabbath day.

1   Dear is the hallowed morn to me,
      When Sabbath bells awake the day,
    And, by their sacred minstrelsy,
      Call me from earthly cares away.

2   And dear to me the wingéd hour,
      Spent in thy hallowed courts, O Lord!
    To feel devotion's soothing power,
      And catch the manna of thy word.

3   And dear to me the loud Amen,
      Which echoes through the blest abode,
    Which swells and sinks, and swells again,
      Dies on the walls, but lives to God.

4   Oft when the world, with iron hands,
      Has bound me in its six days' chain,
    This bursts them, like the strong man's bands,
      And lets my spirit loose again.

5   Go, man of pleasure, strike thy lyre,
      Of broken Sabbaths sing the charms;
    Ours be the prophet's car of fire
      That bears us to a Father's arms.

      More happily than all beside;

      A Sabbath of the eventide.

2   O then the setting sun shines fair,
      And all below, and all above,
    The various forms of Nature, wear
      One universal garb of love.

3   And then the peace that Jesus brought
      The life of grace eternal beams,
    And we, by his example taught,
      Improve the life his love redeems.

4   Delightful scene! a world at rest;
      A God all love; no grief, no fear;
    A heavenly hope, a peaceful breast,
      A smile, unsullied by a tear.

Sabbath Hymn with Nature.


1   King of the world! I worship thee:
      Lord of the mind! the Sabbath's thine:--
    A contrite heart, a bended knee,
      To-day shall be my corn, my wine.
    A choral song for sacrifice
      Will mount as fire, and heavenward own
    The green-leaved earth, through joys and sighs
      A satellite round Mercy's throne.

2   The moon comes up to wake the dew,
      And hang a star on every leaf;
    The sun can take a rainbow hue,
      To kiss away the meadow's grief;
    The wave will lay its buoyance by,
      To let the cloud take anchor there;
    Earth, through her flowers, salutes the sky;
      The sky meets earth in balmy air.

3   And I was born to see and say
      How beauty beams, without, within:
    From the fly, made to gild a day,
      To my own soul, outliving sin.
    Even now I feel thy cherubim
      Have come to me from thee, All-wise!--
    Then, Silence, thou shalt be my hymn,
      And thought, my only sacrifice.

      Bridal of earth and sky,
    The dew shall weep thy fall to-night,
      For thou, alas! must die.

2   Sweet rose! in air whose odors wave,
      And color charms the eye,
    Thy root is ever in its grave,
      And thou, alas! must die.

3   Sweet spring! of days and roses made,
      Whose charms for beauty vie,
    Thy days depart, thy roses fade;
      Thou too, alas! must die.

4   Only a sweet and holy soul
      Hath tints that never fly;
    While flowers decay, and seasons roll,
      This lives, and cannot die.

1   To Thee, my God! to thee I bring
    The evening's grateful offering;
    From thee, the source of joy above,
    Flow everlasting streams of love;
    And all the rays of light that shine,
    And bless creation, Lord! are thine.

2   The morn, when stepping down the hills--
    The noon, which all creation fills
    With glory; evening's placid fall,
    The twilight and the raven pall
    Of midnight; all alike proclaim
    Thy great, thine all impressive name.

3   And from the little worm, whose light
    Shines palely through the shades of night,
    Up to the sparkling stars that run
    Their evening rounds--or glorious sun,
    Rolling his car to twilight's rest--
    All, all in thee is bright and blest.

4   And over all--above, below,
    We see thee--ever-present thou!
    In every wandering rill that flows,
    In every gentle breeze that blows;
    In every rising, setting sun,
    We trace thee--own thee--holy One!

5   Yes! in the mid-day's fervid beams,
    And in the midnight's shadowy dreams,
    In action and repose, we see,
    We recognize and worship thee;
    To thee our worthiest songs would give,
    And in thee die, and to thee live.

3   Showers from thee must bid it thrive,
    Breath of thine must oft revive;
    Light from thee its bloom supplies,--

4   Thine, O Lord! the power and praise
    Which a sight like this displays;

    Confiding, believing,
      Oh! enter always,
    "His courts with thanksgiving--
      His portals with praise!"

3   Nor come to the temple
      With pride in thy mien;
    But lowly and simple,
      In courage serene.

Light and Darkness.


1   Our Father, when beside the tomb
      We mourn the unconscious dead below,
    Thy angels come amid the gloom,
      With solace for our doubt and woe.
    And looking through the shades of death
      To that bright land where none can die,
    How clearly then the eye of faith
      Beholds the portals of the sky!

2   And they whose lives serenely even
      In pleasure's flowery way have kept,
    Have never known the love of heaven,
      As they whose souls have mourned and wept!
    For stricken by the hand of woe,
      The soul must seek a Father's love,
    And they who weep can only know
      What healing balm is found above!

3   And one repentant hour of tears,
      Of sweet communion and of prayer,
    Is worth a thousand, thousand years
      Where pleasure's thoughtless children are!
    And O, if ever man below
      Draws nearer to the eternal throne,
    'Tis when his soul, subdued by woe,
      Seeks refuge with its God above!

2   So, when in silence nature sleeps,
    And his lone watch the mourner keeps,
    One thought, shall every pang remove--
    Trust, feeble man, thy Maker's love.

3   Blessed be the voice that breathes from heaven,
    To every heart in sunder riven,
    When love, and joy, and hope are fled,
    "Lo it is I!--be not afraid."

Joy after Sorrow.


1   As, when the deluge-waves were gone,
      Hills, plains, and vales in freshness burst,
    And nature's earliest rainbow shone
      On scenes more lovely than the first,

2   Loosed from the ark, a heavenly dove,
      The promise-branch of olive bore,--
    Pledge of returning peace and love
      That beamed more brightly than before:--

3   So when affliction's waters glide
      From the enfranchised soul away,
    More peaceful, pure, and sanctified,
      The soul emerges into day.

4   And then, as with the olive bough
      The heavenly dove of old drew near,
    Some gentle words of truth will flow,
      In holy music on the ear.

5   O'er all the transient things of time,
      The oblivious foot of years hath trod;
    But all that's sacred and sublime
      Stands steadfast as the truth of God.

      Thou never wilt forsake;
    And though a bruiséd reed I be,
      That reed thou wilt not break.

      Support me on my way,
    Though, worn with poverty and woe,

    Where are the dews that fed thee
      On Ethan's barren shore?
    That fire from heaven that led thee
      Now lights thy path no more!

2   Lord, thou didst love Jerusalem!
      Once she was all thy own!
    Her love thy fairest heritage,
      Her power thy glory's throne;
    Till evil came and blighted
      Thy long-loved olive tree,
    And Salem's shrines were lighted
      For other gods than thee.

3   Then sunk the star of Solyma,
      Then passed her glory's day,
    Like heath that in the wilderness
      The wild wind whirls away.
    Silent and waste her bowers,
      Where once the mighty trod;
    And sunk those guilty towers,
      Where Baal reigned as God.

Remonstrance with the Jews.


1   Why on the bending willows hung,
      Israel! still sleeps thy tuneful string?--
    Still mute remains thy sullen tongue,
      And Zion's song denies to sing?

2   Awake! thy sweetest raptures raise;
      Let harp and voice unite their strains
    Thy promised King his sceptre sways;
      Jesus, thine own Messiah, reigns!

3   No taunting foes the song require:
      No strangers mock thy captive chain:
    But friends provoke the silent lyre,
      And brethren ask the holy strain.

4   Nor fear thy Salem's hills to wrong,
      If other lands thy triumph share:
    A heavenly city claims thy song;
      A brighter Salem rises there.

5   By foreign streams no longer roam;
      Nor, weeping, think of Jordan's flood:
    In every clime behold a home,
      In every temple see thy God.

The Glory of the Redeemed.


1   Hear what God the Lord hath spoken,
      "O my people, faint and few,
    Comfortless, afflicted, broken,
      Fair abodes I build for you;
    Thorns of heart-felt tribulation
      Shall no more perplex your ways;
    Ye shall name your walls, Salvation,
      And your gates shall all be praise.

2   "There, like streams that feed the garden,
      Pleasures without end shall flow;
    For the Lord, your faith rewarding,
      All his bounty shall bestow;
    Still, in undisturbed possession,
      Peace and righteousness shall reign:
    Never shall you feel oppression,
      Hear the voice of war again.

3   "Ye no more your suns descending,
      Waning moons no more shall see;
    But, your griefs forever ending,
      Find eternal noon in me;
    God shall rise, and shining o'er you,
      Change to day the gloom of night;
    He, the Lord, shall be your glory,
      God, your everlasting light."

The Noble Army of Martyrs.


1   The triumphs of the martyred saints
      The joyous lay demand;
    The heart delights in song to dwell
      On that victorious band--
    Those whom the senseless world abhorred,
      Who cast the world aside,
    Deeming it worthless, for the sake
      Of Christ, their Lord and Guide.

2   For him they braved the tyrant's rage,
      The scourge's cruel smart;
    The wild beast's fang their bodies tore,
      But vanquished not the heart;
    Like lambs before the sword they fell,
      Nor cry nor plaint expressed;
    For patience kept the conscious mind
      And armed the fearless breast.

3   What tongue can tell the crown prepared
      The martyr's brow to grace?
    His shining robe, his joys unknown,
      Before thy glorious face?
    Vouchsafe us, Lord, if such thy will.
      Clear skies and seasons calm;
    If not, the martyr's cross to bear,
      And win the martyr's palm.

1   Flung to the heedless winds,
      Or on the waters cast,
    Their ashes shall be watched,
      And gathered at the last:
    And from that scattered dust,
      Around us and abroad,
    Shall spring a plenteous seed
      Of witnesses for God.

2   The Father hath received
      Their latest living breath;
    Yet vain is Satan's boast
      Of victory in their death:
    Still, still, though dead, they speak,
      And trumpet-tongued proclaim
    To many a wakening land
      The one availing name.

    Who followed him, obeyed, adored,

2     For all thy saints, O God,
      Accept our thankful cry,
    Who counted Christ their great reward,
      And strove in him to die.

3     They all, in life and death,
      With him, their Lord in view,
    Learned from thy Holy Spirit's breath

    Never in the whirlwind found,
      Or where earthquakes rock the place
    Still and silent is the sound,
      The whisper of thy grace.

2   From the world of sin, and noise,
      And hurry, I withdraw;
    For the small and inward voice
      I wait with humble awe;
    Silent I am now and still,
      Dare not in thy presence move;
    To my waiting soul reveal
      The secret of thy love.

"A Hiding-place from the Wind," &c.


1   When dread misfortune's tempests rise,
    And roar through all the darkened skies,
    Where shall the anxious pilgrim gain
    A shelter from the wind and rain?
    Within the covert of thy grace,
    O Lord, there is a hiding-place,
    Where, unconcerned, we hear the sound,
    Though storm and tempest rage around.

2   When, wandering o'er the desert bare
    Of burning sands and sultry air,
    We've sought the cheerless region through,
    But found no stream to meet our view,--
    'Tis then, the rivers of thy love,
    Descending from thy throne above,
    Supply our wants, and soothe our pain,
    And raise our fainting souls again.

3   When in a weary land we tire,
    And our exhausted powers expire,
    With toil, and care, and heat oppressed,
    Where shall our languid spirits rest?
    O, who could bear the blasting ray,
    And all the burden of the day,
    Did not a Rock in Zion stand,
    O'ershading all this weary land!

On Opening an Organ.


1   All nature's works his praise declare
      To whom they all belong;
    There is a voice in every star,
      In every breeze a song.
    Sweet music fills the world abroad
      With strains of love and power;
    The stormy sea sings praise to God--
      The thunder and the shower.

2   To God the tribes of ocean cry,
      And birds upon the wing;
    To God, the powers that dwell on high
      Their tuneful tribute bring.
    Like them let man the throne surround,
      With them loud chorus raise,
    While instruments of loftiest sound
      Assist his feeble praise.

3   Great God! to thee we consecrate
      Our voices and our skill;
    We bid the pealing organ wait
      To speak alone thy will.
    Oh, teach its rich and swelling notes
      To lift our souls on high;
    And while the music round us floats,
      Let earth-born passion die.

    And youth and pleasure fill the throne,
      Our hearts and hands we join;

2   But for those stern and wintry days
      Of sorrow, pain, and fear,
    When Heaven's wise discipline doth make
      Our earthly journey drear;--

3   Not for this span of life alone,
      Which like a blast doth fly,
    And as the transient flowers of grass,
      Just blossom, droop, and die;--

4   But for a being without end
      This vow of love we take;
    Grant us, O God, one home at last,
      For thy great mercy's sake.

      Wield thy sword, the word of God.

5   Thine the helmet of salvation,
      Faith thy mighty shield shall be;
    And let prayer and supplication,
      Lance and glorious falchion be;

6   Onward then, with bold contending,
      In the path the martyrs trod:
    God to thee his strength is lending;
      Onward, in the strength of God.

1   Amid surrounding gloom and waste,
      From nature's face we flee;
    And in our fear and wonder haste
      O nature's life, to thee!
    Thy ways are in the mighty deep;
      In tempests as they blow;
    In floods that o'er our treasures sweep;
      The lightning; and the snow.

2   Though earth upon its axis reels,
      And heaven is veiled in wrath;
    Not one of nature's million wheels
      Breaks its appointed path;
    Fixed in thy grasp, the sources meet
      Of beauty and of awe;
    In storm or calm, all pulses beat
      True to the central law.

3   Thou art that law, whose will thus done
      In seeming wreck and blight,
    Sends the calm planets round the sun,
      And pours the moon's soft light.
    We trust thy love; thou best dost know
      The universal peace;
    How long the stormy force should blow,
      And when the flood should cease.

4   And though around our path some form
      Of mystery ever lies,
    And life is like the calm and storm
      That checker earth and skies,
    Through all its mingling joy and dread,
      Permit us, Holy One,
    By faith to see the golden thread
      Of thy great purpose run.

    Creeds and dogmas all may perish;
      Truth herself can never die.

2   From the glorious heavens above her,
      She has shed her beams abroad,
    That the souls who truly love her,
      May become the sons of God.

3   Worldlings blindly may refuse her,
      Close their eyes and call it night;
    Learned scoffers may abuse her,
      But they cannot quench her light!

4   Thrones may totter, empires crumble,
      All their glories cease to be;
    While she, Christ-like, crowns the humble,
      And from bondage sets them free.

5   God himself will e'er defend her
      From the fury of her foe,
    Till she, in her native splendor,
      Sits enthroned o'er all below.

Active Benevolence.


1   In the morning sow thy seed,
      Nor at eve withhold thy hand;
    Who can tell which may succeed,
      Or if both alike shall stand,
    And a glorious harvest bear,
    To reward the sower's care?

2   Sow it 'mid the haunts of vice--
      Scenes of infamy and crime;
    Suddenly, may Paradise
      Burst, as in the northern clime
    Spring, with all its verdant race,
    Starts from Winter's cold embrace.

3   Sow it with unsparing hand;
      'Tis the kingdom's precious seed,
    'Tis the Master's great command,
      And his grace shall crown the deed;
    He hath said, the precious grain
    Never shall be sown in vain.

Death of a Magistrate or Public Man.


1   Death moves with victor's tread
      In our high places, Lord!
    The honorable dead
      We mourn with one accord;
    Our souls, oppressed, before thee bow,
    Heed thou the prayer, accept the vow.

2   While thus we feel the rod
      Of thine afflictive love,
    Teach us, our fathers' God,
      Thy justice to approve.
    Though all thy ways we cannot trace,
    May we not doubt thy guardian grace.

3   O keep us in thy hand,
      A chosen race for thee;
    And make our own loved land
      The true home of the free;
    Where sin shall cease, and righteousness
    Forever dwell, forever bless.

True Prayer.


1   The Lord is on his holy throne,
      He sits in kingly state;
    Let those who for his favors seek,
      In humble silence wait.

2   True prayer is not th' imposing sound
      That clamorous lips repeat;
    But the deep silence of a soul
      That clasps Jehovah's feet.




DOXOLOGIES.




1006.             H. M.

Doxology.


    Glory to God on high!
      Forever bless his name;
    Let earth, and seas, and sky
      His wondrous love proclaim;
        To him be praise
          And glory given
        By all on earth,
          And all in heaven.




1007.            7s. M.

The Same.


    Praise to God! immortal praise
    From the heavens, the earth, the seas!
    All in one vast chorus join,
    To extol the name divine!




1008.             L. M.

The Same.


    Praise God, from whom all blessings flow!
    Praise him, all creatures here below!
    Praise him, above, ye heavenly throng!
    Praise God, our Father, in your song!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
