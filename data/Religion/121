Prayers for Children


Compiled from Various Sources


Revised Edition



Morning Prayers.


1.

  Now I awake and see the light;
  Lord, Thou hast kept me through the night.
  To Thee I lift my voice and pray
  That Thou wilt keep me through the day.
  If I should die before 'tis done,
  O God, accept me through Thy Son! Amen.


2.

  The morning bright
  With rosy light
  Has waked me from my sleep;
  Father, I own
  Thy love alone
  Thy little one doth keep.

  All through the day,
  I humbly pray,
  Be Thou my Guard and Guide;
  My sins forgive
  And let me live,
  Blest Jesus, near Thy side. Amen.


3.

  Now I raise me up from sleep,
  I thank the Lord who did me keep,
  All through the night; and to Him pray
  That He may keep me through the day.
  All which for Jesus' sake, I say. Amen.


4.

  O help me, Lord, this day to be
  Thy own dear child and follow Thee;
  And lead me, Savior, by Thy hand
  Until I reach the heavenly land. Amen.


5.

  O Lord, my God, to Thee pray
  While from my bed I rise
  That all I do and all I say
  Be pleasing to Thine eyes. Amen.


6.

  Jesus, Lord, to Thee I pray,
  Guide and guard me through this day.
  As the shepherd tends his sheep.
  Lord, me safe from evil keep.
  Keep my feet from every snare,
  Keep me with Thy watchful care.

  All my little wants supply
  If I live or if I die.
  And when life, O Lord, is past,
  Take me to Thyself at last. Amen.


7.

  In the early morning,
  With the sun's first rays.
  All God's little children
  Thank and pray and praise.

  I, too, thanks would offer,
  Jesus, Shepherd dear,
  For Thy tender pasture,
  For Thy guiding care.

  And I would implore Thee,
  Be with me this day,
  Lest I from Thee wander,
  Into danger stray. Amen.


8.

  For this new morning with its light,
  For rest and shelter of the night,
  For health and food, for love and friends.
  For everything Thy goodness sends,
  We thank Thee, dearest Lord. Amen.


9.

  I thank Thee, Lord, for sleep and rest,
  For all the things that I love best,
  Now guide me through another day
  And bless my work and bless my play.
  Lord, make me strong for noble ends,
  Protect and bless my loving friends;
  Of all mankind good Christians make.
  All this I ask for Jesus' sake. Amen.


10.

  Jesus, gentle Shepherd,
  Bless Thy lamb to-day;
  Keep me in Thy footsteps,
  Never let me stray.
  Guard me through the daytime.
  Every hour, I pray;
  Keep my feet from straying
  From the narrow way. Amen.


11.

  Keep my little tongue to-day,
  Keep it gentle while I play;
  Keep my hands from doing wrong.
  Keep my feet the whole day long;
  Keep me all, O Jesus mild,
  Keep me ever Thy dear child. Amen.


12.

  Jesus, keep me all this day.
  When at school and when at play;
  May I do all things I ought,
  May I hate each evil thought;
  Help me love and trust in Thee
  Now and through eternity. Amen.


13.

  O blessed Lord, protect Thou me
  And my dear parents graciously;
  With Thy strong arm be ever near
  To brothers and to sisters dear.
  And all our loved ones in the land,
  Protect them with Thine own right hand.
  From sin defend and keep me free;
  Help me a Christlike child to be. Amen.


14.

  My Father, for another night
  Of quiet sleep and rest.
  For all the joys of morning light,
  Thy holy name be blest. Amen.


15.

  Now with the new-born day I give
  Myself anew to Thee,
  That as Thou willest, I may live,
  And what Thou willest, be. Amen.


16.

  Lord, for the mercies of this night
  My humble thanks I pay
  And unto Thee I give myself
  To-day and every day. Amen.


17.

  Whate'er I do, things great or small
  Whate'er I speak or frame.
  Thy glory may I seek in all,
  Do all in Jesus' name.

  My Father, for His sake I pray.
  Thy child accept and bless
  And lead me by Thy grace to-day
  In paths of righteousness. Amen.


18.

I thank Thee, my heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son,
that Thou hast kept me this night from all harm and danger; and I pray
Thee that Thou wouldst keep me this day also from sin and every evil,
that all my doings and life may please Thee. For into Thy hands I
commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Thy holy angel lie
with me, that the wicked Foe may have no power over me. Amen.




Evening Prayers.


19.

  Savior, lay Thy hand on me,
  Bless me, and remember me. Amen.


20.

  Now I lay me down to sleep;
  I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to keep.
  If I should die before I wake.
  I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to take;
  And this I ask for Jesus' sake. Amen.


21.

  Dear Father in heaven,
  Look down from above;
  Bless papa and mama,
  And those whom I love.

  May angels guard over
  My slumbers, and when
  The morning is breaking,
  Awake me. Amen.


22.

  Now the light has gone away;
  Savior, listen while I pray.
  Asking Thee to watch and keep
  And to send me quiet sleep.

  Jesus, Savior, wash away
  All that has been wrong to-day;
  Help me every day to be
  Good and gentle, more like Thee.

  Let my near and dear ones be
  Always near and dear to Thee.
  O bring me and all I love
  To Thy happy home above. Amen.

  In my little bed I lie:
  Heavenly Father, hear my cry;
  Lord, keep Thou me through this night.

  O God the Son,
  Look down upon
  Thy little one!

  If Thou art near;
  Thou art my Savior
  Kind and dear. Amen.

  Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me:
  Bless Thy little child to-night;
  Through the darkness be Thou near me,
  Keep me safe till morning light.

  All this day Thy hand has led me,
  And I thank Thee for Thy care;
  Thou hast warmed me, clothed me, fed me;
  Listen to my evening prayer.

  May my sins be all forgiven;
  Bless the friends I love so well;
  Take me, Lord, at last to heaven.
  Happy there with Thee to dwell. Amen.


29.

  Lord, send me sleep that I may live;
  The wrongs I've done this day forgive.
  Bless every deed and thought and word
  I've rightly done, or said, or heard.
  Bless relatives and friends alway;
  Teach all the world to watch and pray.
  My thanks for all my blessings take
  And hear my prayer for Jesus' sake.
  Amen.


30.

  Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide,
  The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
  When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
  Help of the helpless, O abide with me! Amen.


31.

  At the close of every day,
  Lord, to Thee I kneel and pray.
  Look upon Thy little child,
  Look in love and mercy mild.
  O forgive and wash away
  All my naughtiness this day,
  And both when I sleep and wake
  Bless me for my Savior's sake. Amen.


32.

  Lord, I have passed another day
  And come to thank Thee for Thy care.
  Forgive my faults in work or play
  And listen to my evening prayer.
  Thy favor gives me daily bread
  And friends, who all my wants supply:
  And safely now I rest my head,
  Preserved and guarded by Thine eye.
  Amen.


33.

  All praise to Thee, my God, this night
  For all the blessings of the light:
  Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
  Beneath Thine own almighty wings. Amen.


34.

  I fall asleep in Jesus' wounds,
  There pardon for my sins abounds;
  Yea, Jesus' blood and righteousness
  My jewels are, my glorious dress,
  Wherein before my God I'll stand
  When I shall reach the heavenly land.
  Amen.


35.

  The toils of day are over;
  I lift my heart to Thee
  And ask that free from peril
  The hours of night may be.
  O Jesus, make their darkness light
  And guard me through the coming night. Amen.


36.

O Lord God, I pray Thee, for Christ's sake, forgive me whatsoever I have
done wrong this day and keep me safe all the night while I am asleep. Amen.


37.

I thank Thee, my heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, that
Thou hast graciously kept me this day; and I pray Thee that Thou wouldst
forgive me all my sins where I have done wrong, and graciously keep me this
night. For into Thy hands I commend myself, my body and soul, and all
things. Let Thy holy angel be with me, that the wicked Foe may have no

Special Prayers.


For Parents.

Almighty and most merciful God, who in Thy infinite goodness hast
committed us unto the charge of loving parents, who are to watch over us
and provide for all our wants of body and soul, we pray Thee, protect
and prolong their life, that we may continue to enjoy their loving care,
and strengthen us that as obedient children we may be subject to their
will and hold them in love and esteem; through Jesus Christ, our Lord
Amen.


For the Teacher.

Dear Father in heaven, who in Thy goodness hast given us teachers that
they may instruct and train us in all useful knowledge, we pray Thee,
bless them with strength and patience so to guide our feeble footsteps
that, being warned, nurtured, comforted, and strengthened, we may do all
things well-pleasing to Thee and profitable to us; through Jesus Christ,
our Lord. Amen.


For the Pastor.


111.

O almighty God, who by Thy Son Jesus Christ didst give to Thy holy
apostles many excellent gifts and commandedst them faithfully to feed
Thy flock, bless, we beseech Thee, our pastor that he may diligently

and obediently to follow the teachings of Thy Word, that we may receive
the crown of everlasting glory; through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.


For a Blessed End.


112.

  While life's paths we still are pressing,
  Grant us, Father, steadfast faith

  Of a peaceful, Christian death. Amen.




The Lord's Prayer.


113.

Our Father who art in heaven; Hallowed be Thy Name; Thy kingdom come;
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven; Give us this day our daily
bread; And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass
against us; And lead us not into temptation; But deliver us from evil;
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and
ever. Amen.




Psalm 23.


114.

1. The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.

2. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the
still waters.

3. He restoreth my soul; He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for
His name's sake.

4. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil; for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort
me.

5. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies;
Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

6. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.




The Common Doxology.


115.

  Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
  Praise Him, all creatures here below;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
